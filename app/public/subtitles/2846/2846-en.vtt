00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:20.189
<i>U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.</i>

2
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.123
<i>Starfleet Base, we've sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?</i>

3
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.625
<i>Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?</i>

4
00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:27.595
<i>Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.</i>

5
00:01:27.698 --> 00:01:28.926
<i>It looks like a lightning storm.</i>

6
00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:30.465
<i>What you've sent us
doesn't seem possible.</i>

7
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:32.828
<i>Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.</i>

8
00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:34.993
- Report.
- It's still out of visual range.

9
00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:36.936
<i>- Give me 20 seconds.
- Alert Captain Robau</i>

10
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.203
<i>that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.</i>

11
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.675
Polarize the viewscreen.

12
00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:43.211
<i>Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?</i>

13
00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:44.644
Captain, we have visual.

14
00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:47.740
<i>- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, Lieutenant.</i>

15
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.284
<i>You're 75,000 kilometers from...</i>

16
00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.251
Captain, are you seeing this?

17
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.914
My God.

18
00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.343
I have a reading.

19
00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:19.312
- They've locked weapons on us!
- Red alert!

20
00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.475
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

21
00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:22.609
- mark 2.
- Arm weapons!

22
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:26.350
Evasive pattern Delta-five!

23
00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:29.552
Incoming fast!

24
00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.561
Fire all phasers! Damage report.

25
00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:41.831
<i>Warp drive's been knocked out!
Never seen anything like it.</i>

26
00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.032
Weapons are off-line. Main power 38%.

27
00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:47.007
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

28
00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.284
Lieutenant!

29
00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:04.053
Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.

30
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:06.129
- Were our shields even up?
- Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

31
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.129
- We have confirmed casualties, sir.
- Shields 11% and dropping.

32
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.698
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

33
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.169
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

34
00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.432
<i>Hello.</i>

35
00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:21.338
<i>My commander requests
the presence of your Captain</i>

36
00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:23.777
<i>in order to negotiate a cease-fire.</i>

37
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.815
<i>You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.</i>

38
00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:29.545
<i>Your refusal would be unwise.</i>

39
00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:43.665
Walk with me.

40
00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:52.904
If I don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

41
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.705
- Sir, we could issue...
- There is no help for us out here.

42
00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:57.245
Use autopilot.

43
00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.947
- And get off this ship.
- Aye, Captain.

44
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:03.246
You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk.

45
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:18.350
His heart rate's elevated.

46
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.411
Look at this ship.

47
00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:47.816
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

48
00:05:48.892 --> 00:05:52.055
- Is it him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

49
00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:56.792
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

50
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.249
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

51
00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:19.113
I'm unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

52
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.520
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

53
00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:28.322
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

54
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.895
Where are you from?

55
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.240
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again!

56
00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:42.834
Bravo-six maneuver! Fire full spread!

57
00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.952
- Seventeen more out!
- I'm initiating General Order 13!

58
00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:57.788
- We're evacuating!
- Yes, sir!

59
00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:06.333
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

60
00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:08.370
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

61
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:10.268
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

62
00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:11.806
You'll deliver in the shuttle. Go!

63
00:07:17.714 --> 00:07:21.411
Move! This one's closed!
Let's go! Get him up!

64
00:07:21.785 --> 00:07:22.979
I'm on my way!

65
00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:26.353
<i>- George.
- You're okay. Thank God.</i>

66
00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:29.458
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

67
00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:31.385
<i>- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

68
00:07:31.494 --> 00:07:35.555
<i>- Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.</i>

69
00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:38.828
<i>- Our baby, it's coming now.
- I'm on my way.</i>

70
00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:47.138
<i>Autopilot function has been destroyed.</i>

71
00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:49.402
<i>Manual operation only.</i>

72
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.971
Clear those decks now!
Get to the shuttles! Move, move, move!

73
00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:56.280
Get to the hangar deck!
Get to the hangar deck! Let's move it!

74
00:07:58.088 --> 00:08:00.682
- That was a big one.
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

75
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.554
- And the baby, too, right?
- And the baby, too.

76
00:08:08.832 --> 00:08:11.164
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

77
00:08:15.438 --> 00:08:17.872
<i>Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?</i>

78
00:08:17.974 --> 00:08:20.602
- Yes, sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

79
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.270
- We're waiting on you, sir.
- No, just go. Take off immediately.

80
00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:25.578
<i>- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.</i>

81
00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:27.476
No, wait! We can't go yet!

82
00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:32.877
Please stop! Stop!

83
00:08:34.324 --> 00:08:37.623
George? The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

84
00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:39.255
Sweetheart, listen to me.

85
00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:41.994
<i>I'm not gonna be there.</i>

86
00:08:42.132 --> 00:08:44.259
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

87
00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:46.995
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here!

88
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.196
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

89
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:52.331
George, I can't do this without you.

90
00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:54.808
Okay, I need you to push now.

91
00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:13.980
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

92
00:10:14.357 --> 00:10:15.551
A boy?

93
00:10:16.993 --> 00:10:18.290
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

94
00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:20.923
<i>He's beautiful.</i>

95
00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:24.591
George, you should be here.

96
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:27.702
<i>Impact alert.</i>

97
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.331
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

98
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.836
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

99
00:10:38.748 --> 00:10:41.740
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

100
00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:47.254
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

101
00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:54.160
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?
- I hear you!

102
00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:57.893
I love you so much. I love you...

103
00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.213
<i>Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.</i>

104
00:12:18.314 --> 00:12:20.874
<i>You think you can get away with this
just 'cause your mother's off planet?</i>

105
00:12:20.984 --> 00:12:23.350
<i>You get your ass back home now!</i>

106
00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:27.082
<i>You live in my house, buddy.
You live in my house, and that's my car.</i>

107
00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:30.056
<i>You get one scratch on that car,
and I'm gonna whip your...</i>

108
00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:44.772
Yeah!

109
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.681
Hey, Johnny!

110
00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:17.931
Citizen! Pull over.

111
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.465
No!

112
00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:14.522
Is there a problem, Officer?

113
00:14:15.098 --> 00:14:17.191
Citizen, what is your name?

114
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:19.963
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

115
00:14:38.354 --> 00:14:40.914
<i>What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?</i>

116
00:14:41.023 --> 00:14:43.617
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

117
00:14:44.026 --> 00:14:44.993
One-point-two-six.

118
00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:46.083
An ellipse.

119
00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:47.992
<i>What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?</i>

120
00:14:48.164 --> 00:14:49.927
Positive two-thirds.

121
00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:54.867
<i>What is the square root of 2,396,324?</i>

122
00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:56.836
<i>- 1,548.
- What is the dimensionality...</i>

123
00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:59.635
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

124
00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:03.473
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

125
00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:07.242
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

126
00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:11.546
Spock!

127
00:15:13.723 --> 00:15:16.715
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today.

128
00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:18.491
Affirmative.

129
00:15:26.702 --> 00:15:30.331
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

130
00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:33.431
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and
therefore have no place in this universe.

131
00:15:33.543 --> 00:15:36.410
Look. He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

132
00:15:36.512 --> 00:15:40.004
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

133
00:15:41.617 --> 00:15:46.714
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

134
00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:17.375
They called you a traitor.

135
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.591
Emotions run deep within our race.

136
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:28.128
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

137
00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:31.758
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

138
00:16:32.268 --> 00:16:36.967
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

139
00:16:40.142 --> 00:16:43.270
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan,

140
00:16:43.913 --> 00:16:45.972
and yet, you married a human.

141
00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.209
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty

142
00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:51.013
to observe
and understand human behavior.

143
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:53.384
Marrying your mother was

144
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.152
logical.

145
00:16:58.694 --> 00:17:03.529
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

146
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.701
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

147
00:17:11.207 --> 00:17:13.835
This is something only you can decide.

148
00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:22.112
Spock, come here, let me see you.

149
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.788
- No.
- Spock.

150
00:17:34.697 --> 00:17:38.997
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

151
00:17:39.302 --> 00:17:41.463
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

152
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.301
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

153
00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:47.266
Okay.

154
00:17:54.984 --> 00:17:58.147
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

155
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.690
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

156
00:18:05.328 --> 00:18:07.228
and purge all emotion,

157
00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:12.597
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

158
00:18:15.671 --> 00:18:16.933
Spock.

159
00:18:19.342 --> 00:18:22.743
As always, whatever you choose to be,

160
00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:26.043
you will have a proud mother.

161
00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:34.488
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

162
00:18:34.623 --> 00:18:38.457
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

163
00:18:38.894 --> 00:18:42.591
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

164
00:18:42.698 --> 00:18:45.064
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

165
00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.192
Logical, but unnecessary.

166
00:18:47.303 --> 00:18:50.363
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

167
00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:51.940
It is truly remarkable, Spock,

168
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:55.340
that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

169
00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:57.340
All rise!

170
00:19:01.117 --> 00:19:03.415
If you would clarify, Minister,

171
00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:07.811
- to what disadvantage are you referring?
- Your human mother.

172
00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:16.098
Council. Ministers, I must decline.

173
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:18.894
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

174
00:19:19.001 --> 00:19:21.697
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

175
00:19:21.804 --> 00:19:25.501
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

176
00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:27.906
Why did you come
before this council today?

177
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.535
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

178
00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:33.706
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

179
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.311
Thank you, Ministers,
for your consideration.

180
00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:42.053
Live long and prosper.

181
00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.268
- How are you?
- Hey.

182
00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:05.407
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.349
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics,

184
00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:20.361
- two Cardassian Sunrises and...
- Gotta try the Slusho. It's good.

185
00:20:20.496 --> 00:20:22.054
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

186
00:20:22.164 --> 00:20:24.826
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

187
00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:29.030
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

188
00:20:29.138 --> 00:20:31.333
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

189
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.169
Don't you want to at least
know my name

190
00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:34.765
before you completely reject me?

191
00:20:34.877 --> 00:20:37.903
- I'm fine without it.
- You are fine without it.

192
00:20:38.314 --> 00:20:40.145
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

193
00:20:41.984 --> 00:20:45.579
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

194
00:20:45.955 --> 00:20:48.082
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way!

195
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.658
That's the name
I was gonna make up for you.

196
00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:53.091
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

197
00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:54.787
They don't have last names
in your world?

198
00:20:54.897 --> 00:20:56.262
Uhura is my last name.

199
00:20:56.365 --> 00:20:59.528
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

200
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.262
Excuse me, buddy.

201
00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:05.431
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

202
00:21:05.541 --> 00:21:08.009
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

203
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.809
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

204
00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:16.210
It means you've got a talented tongue.

205
00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:18.246
I'm impressed.

206
00:21:18.354 --> 00:21:20.345
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

207
00:21:20.456 --> 00:21:25.359
- who only has sex with farm animals.
- Well, not only.

208
00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:28.924
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

209
00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:31.556
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

210
00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:33.658
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

211
00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:38.035
- Hey, you better mind your manners.
- Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

212
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.804
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

213
00:21:42.912 --> 00:21:46.473
So get some more guys,
and then it'll be an even fight.

214
00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:51.277
Guys, stop it.

215
00:21:53.856 --> 00:21:55.084
Stop it!

216
00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:17.837
Enough!

217
00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:26.918
Guys, he's had enough!

218
00:22:32.361 --> 00:22:34.158
Outside, all of you.

219
00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:36.655
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

220
00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:38.860
- He wouldn't even listen!
- I just bought a drink.

221
00:22:38.968 --> 00:22:40.833
- Can you believe this?
- It's not really fair.

222
00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:43.496
- Come on.
- You all right, son?

223
00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:46.439
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

224
00:22:47.543 --> 00:22:49.943
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

225
00:22:50.045 --> 00:22:53.105
- And who am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

226
00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:58.279
Can I get another one?

227
00:22:58.387 --> 00:23:01.117
<i>For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.</i>

228
00:23:01.223 --> 00:23:05.353
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

229
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:06.928
He sure learned his lesson.

230
00:23:07.129 --> 00:23:08.619
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

231
00:23:08.731 --> 00:23:10.961
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

232
00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:14.092
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

233
00:23:14.203 --> 00:23:16.501
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

234
00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:19.506
- Why are you talking to me, man?
- 'Cause I looked up your file

235
00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:22.202
while you were drooling on the floor.

236
00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:26.042
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

237
00:23:26.148 --> 00:23:28.946
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

238
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.746
Maybe I love it.

239
00:23:30.853 --> 00:23:34.550
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

240
00:23:34.657 --> 00:23:38.149
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

241
00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:40.188
Something special?

242
00:23:42.264 --> 00:23:44.528
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

243
00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:48.667
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

244
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:52.969
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

245
00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:57.946
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

246
00:23:58.681 --> 00:24:01.650
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

247
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.684
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada...

248
00:24:03.786 --> 00:24:06.687
- Are we done?
- I'm done.

249
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.787
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

250
00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:23.397
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

251
00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:28.672
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

252
00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:31.879
I dare you to do better.

253
00:25:56.865 --> 00:25:58.264
Nice ride, man.

254
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.469
It's yours.

255
00:26:04.173 --> 00:26:06.801
Four years? I'll do it in three.

256
00:26:22.524 --> 00:26:24.253
At ease, gentlemen.

257
00:26:43.011 --> 00:26:46.447
- Never did get that first name.
- You need a doctor.

258
00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:48.675
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor!

259
00:26:48.784 --> 00:26:49.773
You need to get back to your seat.

260
00:26:49.885 --> 00:26:50.943
I had one in the bathroom
with no windows.

261
00:26:51.053 --> 00:26:53.146
- You need to get back to your seat now.
- I suffer from aviaphobia.

262
00:26:53.255 --> 00:26:54.722
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

263
00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:58.919
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I'll make you sit down!

264
00:27:01.063 --> 00:27:03.463
- Fine.
- Thank you.

265
00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:07.566
<i>This is Captain Pike.
We've been cleared for takeoff.</i>

266
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.462
I may throw up on you.

267
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.835
I think these things are pretty safe.

268
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.306
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

269
00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:16.707
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

270
00:27:16.812 --> 00:27:19.645
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

271
00:27:19.748 --> 00:27:22.683
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

272
00:27:22.784 --> 00:27:26.083
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

273
00:27:26.188 --> 00:27:29.749
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

274
00:27:29.858 --> 00:27:33.658
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

275
00:27:33.762 --> 00:27:35.821
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

276
00:27:35.931 --> 00:27:39.264
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

277
00:27:39.368 --> 00:27:41.427
All I got left is my bones.

278
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:50.675
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

279
00:28:37.993 --> 00:28:41.656
Captain Nero! You've been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

280
00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:43.560
Ayel says it's time.

281
00:28:48.704 --> 00:28:54.006
Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

282
00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:56.373
- What are your orders?
- We wait.

283
00:28:57.179 --> 00:29:00.842
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

284
00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:03.315
as we've been doing for 25 years.

285
00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.383
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

286
00:29:07.823 --> 00:29:11.350
I'm not gonna kill him.
I'm gonna make him watch.

287
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:27.138
Capture that ship!

288
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.539
Welcome back, Spock.

289
00:29:34.649 --> 00:29:35.843
Why are you so happy?

290
00:29:35.951 --> 00:29:38.283
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, I don't suppose you do.

291
00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:39.877
Hello, ladies!

292
00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:42.116
- I'm taking the test again.
- You gotta be kidding.

293
00:29:42.224 --> 00:29:43.953
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

294
00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:45.219
You know, I've got better things to do

295
00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:47.386
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

296
00:29:47.496 --> 00:29:48.895
I'm a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

297
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:51.261
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

298
00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:54.028
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

299
00:29:54.136 --> 00:29:57.196
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

300
00:29:57.305 --> 00:29:58.772
I gotta study.

301
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:01.133
Study, my ass.

302
00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:08.873
- Jim, I think I love you.
- That is so weird.

303
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:11.246
<i>- Lights.
- Lights on.</i>

304
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.610
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

305
00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:15.781
- Yeah, I did, but...
- You don't love me, too?

306
00:30:15.891 --> 00:30:17.222
Oh, my God, my roommate!

307
00:30:17.325 --> 00:30:18.519
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

308
00:30:18.627 --> 00:30:20.458
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

309
00:30:20.562 --> 00:30:22.154
- Under...
- Look, just get under the bed.

310
00:30:22.264 --> 00:30:23.925
- Come on!
- She can't see you here.

311
00:30:24.032 --> 00:30:25.431
- Why not?
- Because I promised her

312
00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:26.762
- I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
- Really?

313
00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:29.564
- Well, how many guys have you...
- Just down! Just down!

314
00:30:31.873 --> 00:30:32.897
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:30:33.008 --> 00:30:34.441
- How are you?
- Good.

316
00:30:34.543 --> 00:30:37.603
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

317
00:30:37.712 --> 00:30:39.475
Yeah, I thought all night.

318
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:43.950
I was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

319
00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:47.681
- Really?
- Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

320
00:30:48.223 --> 00:30:49.315
- No.
- Yeah.

321
00:30:49.424 --> 00:30:51.949
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

322
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.029
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

323
00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:00.694
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

324
00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:03.100
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

325
00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:04.729
You could hear me breathing?

326
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.364
- You!
- Big day tomorrow.

327
00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:09.171
- You're gonna fail. Get out.
- Gaila, see you around.

328
00:31:09.277 --> 00:31:10.710
If I pass,
will you tell me your first name?

329
00:31:10.812 --> 00:31:12.541
- No! Good night.
- I think the fact

330
00:31:12.647 --> 00:31:15.411
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

331
00:31:17.385 --> 00:31:20.684
<i>We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.</i>

332
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:22.757
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

333
00:31:22.858 --> 00:31:24.723
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

334
00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:27.852
"Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

335
00:31:29.097 --> 00:31:30.325
"Captain. "

336
00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:33.130
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

337
00:31:33.235 --> 00:31:35.999
- and are locking weapons on us.
- That's okay.

338
00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:38.805
<i>- That's okay?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.</i>

339
00:31:39.207 --> 00:31:41.334
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?

340
00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:43.240
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

341
00:31:43.578 --> 00:31:46.479
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

342
00:31:46.581 --> 00:31:49.175
- I don't suppose this is a problem either.
- They're firing, Captain.

343
00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:52.246
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members

344
00:31:52.354 --> 00:31:53.480
from the damaged ship.

345
00:31:53.588 --> 00:31:55.317
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

346
00:31:55.423 --> 00:31:58.119
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

347
00:31:58.226 --> 00:31:59.693
Alert Medical.

348
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.521
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

349
00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:06.692
- I understand.
- Well, should we, I don't know,

350
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:08.268
fire back?

351
00:32:08.537 --> 00:32:10.368
- No.
- Of course not.

352
00:32:17.746 --> 00:32:19.941
What is this? What's going on?

353
00:32:23.552 --> 00:32:25.782
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

354
00:32:25.887 --> 00:32:28.048
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

355
00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:29.384
Are they?

356
00:32:31.126 --> 00:32:32.787
No. They're not.

357
00:32:33.361 --> 00:32:34.885
Fire on all enemy ships.

358
00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:37.624
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

359
00:32:37.732 --> 00:32:40.633
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

360
00:32:45.774 --> 00:32:48.174
- All ships destroyed, Captain.
- Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

361
00:32:48.276 --> 00:32:51.939
So! We've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

362
00:32:52.047 --> 00:32:53.639
no one onboard was injured,

363
00:32:53.748 --> 00:32:59.118
<i>and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.</i>

364
00:33:03.658 --> 00:33:06.456
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

365
00:33:09.164 --> 00:33:10.631
I do not know.

366
00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:14.861
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

367
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.363
James T. Kirk, step forward.

368
00:33:19.274 --> 00:33:22.038
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

369
00:33:22.143 --> 00:33:24.873
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

370
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.438
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

371
00:33:29.584 --> 00:33:33.020
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

372
00:33:33.855 --> 00:33:37.621
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

373
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.789
Step forward, please.

374
00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:48.028
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

375
00:33:48.136 --> 00:33:52.095
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

376
00:33:53.842 --> 00:33:56.834
- Commander?
- Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

377
00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:59.311
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

378
00:33:59.414 --> 00:34:02.281
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

379
00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:06.611
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular, you cheated.

380
00:34:08.456 --> 00:34:12.187
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

381
00:34:12.794 --> 00:34:15.228
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

382
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.230
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

383
00:34:17.332 --> 00:34:19.892
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

384
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:23.562
- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
- Then not only did you violate the rules,

385
00:34:23.672 --> 00:34:25.640
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

386
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.230
Please, enlighten me.

387
00:34:27.342 --> 00:34:29.537
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

388
00:34:29.644 --> 00:34:31.805
a captain cannot cheat death.

389
00:34:35.016 --> 00:34:36.244
I of all people?

390
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:39.650
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel

391
00:34:39.754 --> 00:34:41.415
before being killed in action, did he not?

392
00:34:41.523 --> 00:34:43.286
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

393
00:34:43.391 --> 00:34:45.518
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

394
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:49.119
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose is to experience fear,

395
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:51.999
fear in the face of certain death.

396
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.230
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

397
00:34:56.338 --> 00:34:59.739
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

398
00:35:02.477 --> 00:35:03.774
Excuse me, sir.

399
00:35:10.352 --> 00:35:12.877
We've received a distress call
from Vulcan.

400
00:35:12.987 --> 00:35:16.047
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

401
00:35:16.157 --> 00:35:20.560
I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

402
00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:31.096
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I don't know, but I like him.

403
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.607
<i>Fugeman, Regula One!
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut!</i>

404
00:35:38.713 --> 00:35:41.978
<i>McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise!
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott!</i>

405
00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:45.575
<i>Rader, U.S.S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.</i>

406
00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:49.914
He didn't call my name.

407
00:35:50.658 --> 00:35:55.322
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

408
00:35:55.597 --> 00:35:56.962
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

409
00:35:57.065 --> 00:35:59.932
That means you're grounded
until the Academy Board rules.

410
00:36:00.034 --> 00:36:02.798
All right, listen up! I'm gonna read
this list one time, and one time only!

411
00:36:03.671 --> 00:36:07.732
Jim, the Board will rule in your favor.
Most likely.

412
00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:13.002
- Look, Jim, I gotta go.
- Yeah.

413
00:36:13.314 --> 00:36:15.214
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

414
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:24.986
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

415
00:36:29.898 --> 00:36:31.092
Damn it.

416
00:36:33.802 --> 00:36:37.169
<i>- Come with me.
- U.S.S. Newton! Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut!</i>

417
00:36:37.272 --> 00:36:41.003
<i>Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares!
Go to your stations and good luck.</i>

418
00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:47.175
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

419
00:36:49.451 --> 00:36:51.009
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

420
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:53.485
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

421
00:36:53.588 --> 00:36:55.715
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate

422
00:36:55.824 --> 00:36:58.952
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

423
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.324
"an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies"

424
00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:04.796
- in subspace transmissions tests?
- Consistently, yes.

425
00:37:04.899 --> 00:37:06.867
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

426
00:37:06.968 --> 00:37:09.994
<i>is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,
I'm assigned to the Farragut?</i>

427
00:37:10.138 --> 00:37:13.266
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

428
00:37:13.374 --> 00:37:15.842
<i>No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.</i>

429
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:22.140
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

430
00:37:23.151 --> 00:37:25.312
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

431
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.047
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

432
00:37:27.155 --> 00:37:30.420
Take a seat. I'm gonna give you
a vaccine against viral infection

433
00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:34.359
- from Melvaran mud fleas.
- What for?

434
00:37:34.462 --> 00:37:36.657
- To give you the symptoms.
- What are you talking about?

435
00:37:36.764 --> 00:37:38.994
You're gonna start to lose vision
in your left eye.

436
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.260
Yeah, I already have.

437
00:37:40.401 --> 00:37:43.063
Oh, and you're gonna get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

438
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:45.298
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah. You owe me one.

439
00:37:47.675 --> 00:37:52.271
<i>Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.</i>

440
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.870
Medical code states the treatment

441
00:37:53.982 --> 00:37:55.973
and transport of a patient is
to be determined

442
00:37:56.084 --> 00:37:59.144
at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

443
00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:01.119
So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

444
00:38:01.222 --> 00:38:03.588
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

445
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:05.522
<i>why the Enterprise warped into a crisis</i>

446
00:38:05.627 --> 00:38:08.460
without one of its senior
medical officers?

447
00:38:08.563 --> 00:38:12.021
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

448
00:38:29.884 --> 00:38:33.615
- I might throw up on you.
- Jim, you've got to look at this.

449
00:38:34.722 --> 00:38:35.984
- Jim, look.
- What?

450
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.057
Look.

451
00:39:33.448 --> 00:39:37.714
- We need to get you changed. - I don't
feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

452
00:39:37.819 --> 00:39:40.481
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

453
00:39:57.472 --> 00:40:00.202
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

454
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:03.310
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

455
00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:05.709
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

456
00:40:05.813 --> 00:40:09.214
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

457
00:40:09.317 --> 00:40:13.219
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

458
00:40:14.222 --> 00:40:16.486
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

459
00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:17.888
Helm, thrusters.

460
00:40:17.992 --> 00:40:20.324
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

461
00:40:20.428 --> 00:40:22.589
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

462
00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:35.670
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

463
00:40:35.777 --> 00:40:39.838
- Set a course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

464
00:40:41.115 --> 00:40:43.549
Maximum warp. Punch it.

465
00:41:00.568 --> 00:41:02.365
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

466
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.530
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

467
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.107
I'm Hikaru Sulu.

468
00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:10.541
- And you are a pilot, right?
- Very much so, sir.

469
00:41:10.645 --> 00:41:14.012
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

470
00:41:14.115 --> 00:41:18.051
- Is the parking brake on?
- No. I'll figure it out. I'm just...

471
00:41:18.152 --> 00:41:21.417
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

472
00:41:25.426 --> 00:41:27.519
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

473
00:41:35.103 --> 00:41:36.593
- Where are we?
- Medical Bay.

474
00:41:36.704 --> 00:41:38.535
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

475
00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:40.334
- Hi! How are you?
- Come here.

476
00:41:40.441 --> 00:41:43.968
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

477
00:41:44.078 --> 00:41:47.172
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- I wish I didn't know you.

478
00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:49.078
Don't be such an infant.

479
00:41:50.485 --> 00:41:52.043
How long is it supposed to...

480
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.085
Unbelievable.

481
00:41:55.523 --> 00:41:57.889
- Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
- Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

482
00:41:57.992 --> 00:42:01.792
- Chanko? Cherpov?
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

483
00:42:01.896 --> 00:42:05.423
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

484
00:42:05.533 --> 00:42:07.228
Yes, sir. Happy to.

485
00:42:08.035 --> 00:42:11.766
Ensign authorization code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

486
00:42:11.873 --> 00:42:13.841
<i>Authorization not recognized.</i>

487
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:16.102
Ensign authorization code

488
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:20.476
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

489
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.350
May I have your attention, please?

490
00:42:26.187 --> 00:42:31.386
At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.

491
00:42:31.692 --> 00:42:34.957
What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

492
00:42:35.363 --> 00:42:39.993
<i>Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command</i>

493
00:42:40.234 --> 00:42:43.726
<i>that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.</i>

494
00:42:44.272 --> 00:42:48.038
<i>Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan</i>

495
00:42:48.142 --> 00:42:51.407
<i>and assist in evacuations if necessary.</i>

496
00:42:52.013 --> 00:42:56.712
<i>We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.</i>

497
00:42:58.352 --> 00:43:03.085
- Lightning storm.
- Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

498
00:43:04.492 --> 00:43:06.722
- Good God, man.
- What?

499
00:43:08.996 --> 00:43:11.897
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine, damn it!

500
00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:14.160
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone!

501
00:43:14.602 --> 00:43:15.967
Yes, sir!

502
00:43:18.239 --> 00:43:21.072
<i>...appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.</i>

503
00:43:21.175 --> 00:43:23.370
- Hey!
- We gotta stop the ship.

504
00:43:23.945 --> 00:43:27.642
Jim! I'm not kidding!
We need to keep your heart rate down!

505
00:43:27.949 --> 00:43:29.348
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

506
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.577
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

507
00:43:31.686 --> 00:43:34.814
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim, stand still!

508
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.689
Stop it!

509
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.331
- Uhura! Uhura...
- Kirk! What are you doing here?

510
00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:50.370
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

511
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:52.405
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

512
00:43:52.506 --> 00:43:54.440
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

513
00:43:54.542 --> 00:43:56.032
- What?
- And was the ship...

514
00:43:56.143 --> 00:43:57.201
Was the ship what?

515
00:43:57.311 --> 00:43:59.711
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

516
00:43:59.814 --> 00:44:01.782
- Numb tongue?
- I can fix that.

517
00:44:01.883 --> 00:44:03.817
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

518
00:44:03.918 --> 00:44:05.715
- What? I...
- Romulan.

519
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.946
- Romulan?
- Yeah!

520
00:44:07.054 --> 00:44:08.351
- Yes.
- Yes?

521
00:44:08.456 --> 00:44:09.423
Damn it!

522
00:44:43.324 --> 00:44:46.589
<i>Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.</i>

523
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:49.887
- Jim!
- What's going on?

524
00:44:49.997 --> 00:44:51.021
- Jim, come back!
- Kirk!

525
00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:52.929
- Captain! Captain Pike, sir...
- Jim, come back here!

526
00:44:53.034 --> 00:44:54.467
...we have to stop the ship!
- Kirk, how the hell

527
00:44:54.568 --> 00:44:56.092
<i>did you get onboard the Enterprise?</i>

528
00:44:56.203 --> 00:44:57.932
Captain, this man's under the influence

529
00:44:58.039 --> 00:44:59.529
- of a severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, please...

530
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.335
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

531
00:45:01.442 --> 00:45:02.875
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

532
00:45:02.977 --> 00:45:04.308
It's being attacked by Romulans.

533
00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:07.745
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day.

534
00:45:07.848 --> 00:45:09.145
McCoy, take him back to medical.

535
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.808
- We'll have words later.
- Aye, Captain.

536
00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:12.385
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

537
00:45:12.486 --> 00:45:14.215
Mr. Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

538
00:45:14.322 --> 00:45:15.584
- I get it. You're a great arguer.
- By Regulations...

539
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.385
- I'd love to do it again.
... that makes him a stowaway.

540
00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:18.753
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

541
00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:20.349
- Kirk...
- This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

542
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:23.430
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

543
00:45:23.531 --> 00:45:25.192
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

544
00:45:25.299 --> 00:45:27.028
Based on what facts?

545
00:45:29.003 --> 00:45:31.870
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

546
00:45:31.973 --> 00:45:33.907
also occurred on the day of my birth,

547
00:45:34.008 --> 00:45:36.841
<i>before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.</i>

548
00:45:36.944 --> 00:45:38.969
You know that, sir,
I read your dissertation.

549
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.674
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

550
00:45:41.782 --> 00:45:43.477
was never seen or heard from again.

551
00:45:43.584 --> 00:45:45.552
<i>The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,</i>

552
00:45:45.653 --> 00:45:48.417
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

553
00:45:48.556 --> 00:45:51.957
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

554
00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:55.358
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

555
00:45:55.463 --> 00:45:58.261
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

556
00:46:00.634 --> 00:46:03.967
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

557
00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:06.705
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

558
00:46:06.807 --> 00:46:09.867
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

559
00:46:10.678 --> 00:46:12.805
The cadet's logic is sound.

560
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:15.372
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

561
00:46:15.483 --> 00:46:17.348
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

562
00:46:17.451 --> 00:46:20.386
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

563
00:46:20.488 --> 00:46:23.821
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

564
00:46:23.924 --> 00:46:25.892
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

565
00:46:25.993 --> 00:46:27.551
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

566
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:30.721
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

567
00:46:31.032 --> 00:46:32.522
<i>Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.</i>

568
00:46:32.633 --> 00:46:35.101
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

569
00:46:35.202 --> 00:46:37.397
but we seem to have lost all contact.

570
00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:40.201
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission,

571
00:46:40.307 --> 00:46:44.744
- or transmission of any kind in the area.
- It's because they're being attacked.

572
00:46:48.616 --> 00:46:50.448
Shields up. Red alert.

573
00:46:52.486 --> 00:46:54.454
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

574
00:46:55.156 --> 00:46:57.954
Four, three, two...

575
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.159
- Emergency evasive!
- On it, sir.

576
00:47:09.837 --> 00:47:11.429
- Damage report!
- Deflector shields are holding.

577
00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:13.598
All stations! Engineer Olson, report!

578
00:47:23.784 --> 00:47:25.513
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

579
00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:27.086
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

580
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.365
Sir, there's another Federation ship!

581
00:47:48.476 --> 00:47:50.535
- Destroy it, too.
- Fire torpedoes.

582
00:47:50.644 --> 00:47:51.838
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

583
00:47:51.946 --> 00:47:54.380
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

584
00:48:02.256 --> 00:48:04.747
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

585
00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:07.259
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

586
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:08.419
Get me Starfleet Command.

587
00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:11.657
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

588
00:48:11.765 --> 00:48:12.993
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

589
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.624
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

590
00:48:14.735 --> 00:48:16.828
- and transporter abilities.
- All power to forward shields.

591
00:48:16.937 --> 00:48:18.302
Prepare to fire all weapons.

592
00:48:22.943 --> 00:48:25.468
- Weapons ready.
- Wait!

593
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.540
- The hull. Magnify.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:48:33.487 --> 00:48:35.580
Captain, we're being hailed.

595
00:48:36.657 --> 00:48:37.817
<i>Hello.</i>

596
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.627
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

597
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.789
<i>Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero.</i>

598
00:48:44.899 --> 00:48:46.730
You've declared war
against the Federation.

599
00:48:46.834 --> 00:48:49.894
Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

600
00:48:50.004 --> 00:48:53.303
<i>- at a neutral location.
- I do not speak for the Empire.</i>

601
00:48:53.407 --> 00:48:54.897
<i>We stand apart.</i>

602
00:48:56.443 --> 00:49:00.174
<i>As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?</i>

603
00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:05.647
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

604
00:49:05.753 --> 00:49:08.449
<i>No, we're not. Not yet.</i>

605
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.687
<i>Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.</i>

606
00:49:14.228 --> 00:49:17.755
<i>Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.</i>

607
00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:22.267
<i>As you can see by the rest
of your armada, you have no choice.</i>

608
00:49:22.736 --> 00:49:26.832
<i>You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.</i>

609
00:49:27.474 --> 00:49:28.873
<i>That is all.</i>

610
00:49:37.952 --> 00:49:39.817
- He'll kill you. You know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

611
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.889
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

612
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.719
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

613
00:49:44.858 --> 00:49:46.485
I understand that.

614
00:49:47.294 --> 00:49:50.525
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

615
00:49:50.631 --> 00:49:53.862
- I have training, sir.
- Come with me.

616
00:49:54.768 --> 00:49:57.066
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

617
00:49:57.171 --> 00:49:59.867
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

618
00:50:20.995 --> 00:50:22.929
Prepare the red matter.

619
00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:25.695
Yes, sir.

620
00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:06.432
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

621
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.565
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

622
00:51:08.676 --> 00:51:13.579
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

623
00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:16.676
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

624
00:51:16.784 --> 00:51:19.912
that's scrambling our gear.
You'll get inside, you'll disable it,

625
00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.317
then you'll beam back to the ship.

626
00:51:21.422 --> 00:51:24.914
<i>Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.</i>

627
00:51:25.125 --> 00:51:27.525
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

628
00:51:27.628 --> 00:51:30.529
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

629
00:51:30.631 --> 00:51:32.428
And if all else fails, fall back

630
00:51:32.533 --> 00:51:34.592
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

631
00:51:34.702 --> 00:51:36.101
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

632
00:51:36.203 --> 00:51:37.568
- What?
- Captain?

633
00:51:37.671 --> 00:51:40.663
Please, I apologize, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

634
00:51:40.774 --> 00:51:45.336
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I'm not the Captain, you are.

635
00:51:46.447 --> 00:51:47.744
Let's go.

636
00:51:50.784 --> 00:51:53.082
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

637
00:51:53.187 --> 00:51:55.519
Well, I guess you'll have to come
and get me.

638
00:51:55.622 --> 00:51:58.090
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

639
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:11.060
Dr. Puri, report.

640
00:52:11.171 --> 00:52:14.038
It's McCoy.
Dr. Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

641
00:52:15.909 --> 00:52:19.208
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

642
00:52:19.313 --> 00:52:20.780
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

643
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:23.917
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!

644
00:52:24.518 --> 00:52:27.783
<i>Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.</i>

645
00:52:27.888 --> 00:52:30.288
<i>Interval check shows
positive and steady.</i>

646
00:52:30.958 --> 00:52:32.983
- You got the charges, right?
- Oh, yeah.

647
00:52:33.093 --> 00:52:35.891
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

648
00:52:35.996 --> 00:52:37.861
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

649
00:52:41.735 --> 00:52:45.262
<i>Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.</i>

650
00:52:57.584 --> 00:52:59.518
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

651
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.985
Fencing.

652
00:53:04.258 --> 00:53:05.486
Pre-jump.

653
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.322
<i>Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.</i>

654
00:53:19.807 --> 00:53:21.741
<i>Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.</i>

655
00:53:21.842 --> 00:53:24.834
<i>We have one shot
to land on that platform.</i>

656
00:53:24.978 --> 00:53:28.141
<i>They may have defenses,
so pull your chute as late as possible.</i>

657
00:53:28.248 --> 00:53:31.183
Three, two, one.

658
00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.115
<i>Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back</i>

659
00:53:35.222 --> 00:53:36.689
<i>until you turn off that drill.</i>

660
00:53:38.725 --> 00:53:39.749
Good luck.

661
00:54:01.748 --> 00:54:04.273
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

662
00:54:04.384 --> 00:54:05.783
Twenty thousand meters.

663
00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:32.639
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 meters.

664
00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:36.739
<i>Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 meters.</i>

665
00:54:39.553 --> 00:54:41.453
Forty-six hundred meters
from the platform.

666
00:54:41.555 --> 00:54:42.954
Forty-five hundred meters to target.

667
00:54:44.992 --> 00:54:46.425
Four thousand meters.

668
00:54:46.527 --> 00:54:48.654
- Three thousand meters.
- Three thousand meters.

669
00:54:48.762 --> 00:54:50.855
- Two thousand meters.
- Pulling chute.

670
00:54:56.703 --> 00:55:00.002
- Two thousand meters!
- Come on, pull your chute, Olson!

671
00:55:00.374 --> 00:55:03.207
No, not yet! Not yet! 1,500 meters!

672
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:06.871
- Olson, open your chute!
- Olson, pull your chute!

673
00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.675
One thousand meters!

674
00:55:14.087 --> 00:55:15.111
No!

675
00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:22.355
Olson!

676
00:55:23.597 --> 00:55:24.996
Olson is gone, sir!

677
00:55:45.185 --> 00:55:46.880
Kirk has landed, sir.

678
00:57:50.644 --> 00:57:53.272
Give me your hand! Come on.

679
00:57:59.519 --> 00:58:01.350
Olson had the charges.

680
00:58:02.222 --> 00:58:03.416
I know.

681
00:58:05.692 --> 00:58:07.887
- What do we do?
- This.

682
00:58:20.707 --> 00:58:24.006
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are reestablished.

683
00:58:24.111 --> 00:58:27.512
- Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
- Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

684
00:58:27.614 --> 00:58:29.047
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

685
00:58:29.149 --> 00:58:31.344
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

686
00:58:36.656 --> 00:58:40.023
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

687
00:58:40.127 --> 00:58:41.321
Launch the red matter.

688
00:58:56.376 --> 00:58:59.470
<i>Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched
something at the planet</i>

689
00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:00.910
through the hole they just drilled.

690
00:59:01.281 --> 00:59:03.374
<i>- Do you copy, Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.</i>

691
00:59:03.483 --> 00:59:04.973
- Analyzing data now.
- Transporter is now operational.

692
00:59:05.085 --> 00:59:07.883
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

693
00:59:07.988 --> 00:59:10.047
If my calculations are correct,

694
00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:15.220
they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

695
00:59:17.631 --> 00:59:20.998
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

696
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:23.763
- Yes, sir.
- How long does the planet have?

697
00:59:25.906 --> 00:59:27.737
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

698
00:59:29.142 --> 00:59:31.303
Alert Vulcan Command Center
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

699
00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:32.776
- all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, wait!

700
00:59:32.879 --> 00:59:34.642
- Maintain standard orbit.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:59:34.748 --> 00:59:36.807
- Where are you going?
- To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

702
00:59:36.917 --> 00:59:38.908
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

703
00:59:39.019 --> 00:59:41.112
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

704
00:59:41.221 --> 00:59:43.655
<i>It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.</i>

705
00:59:43.757 --> 00:59:45.452
I must get them myself.

706
00:59:45.559 --> 00:59:47.754
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye.

707
00:59:51.264 --> 00:59:55.064
<i>- Kirk to Enterprise! Beam us out of here!
- Stand by. Locking on your signal.</i>

708
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:59.334
- Retract the drill. Let's move out.
- Yes, sir. Pull it up!

709
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:05.437
<i>I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move!</i>

710
01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:07.206
- Kirk!
- Sulu!

711
01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:16.013
Sulu!

712
01:00:19.226 --> 01:00:20.557
Hold on!

713
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:24.724
I got you! Now pull my chute!

714
01:00:31.838 --> 01:00:36.969
<i>Kirk to Enterprise! We're falling
without a chute! Beam us up!</i>

715
01:00:37.077 --> 01:00:38.942
<i>- I'm trying. I can't lock on
to your signal. - Beam us up!</i>

716
01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:40.672
<i>- You're moving too fast.
- Beam us up!</i>

717
01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:43.042
I can do that. I can do that!

718
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.545
- Take the conn!
- Aye, sir.

719
01:00:45.652 --> 01:00:46.710
The black hole's expanding.

720
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.118
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

721
01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:52.482
Move, move, move, move, move!

722
01:00:52.592 --> 01:00:54.423
I can do that! I can do that!
Move, move, move, move!

723
01:00:55.061 --> 01:00:57.188
Quick, give me manual control!
I can lock on!

724
01:00:57.297 --> 01:00:58.628
<i>Beam us up!</i>

725
01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.200
<i>Enterprise, where are you?</i>

726
01:01:02.302 --> 01:01:03.997
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

727
01:01:04.104 --> 01:01:07.403
Now, now, now! Do it now!
Now, now, now, now!

728
01:01:07.507 --> 01:01:12.968
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on! Hold on!
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

729
01:01:18.018 --> 01:01:19.508
Gotcha!

730
01:01:28.862 --> 01:01:31.797
- Thanks.
- No problem.

731
01:01:33.967 --> 01:01:36.731
Clear the pad.
I'm beaming to the surface.

732
01:01:37.537 --> 01:01:39.232
The surface of what?

733
01:01:39.606 --> 01:01:41.836
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

734
01:01:42.676 --> 01:01:44.007
Spock, you can't do that!

735
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.702
- Energize.
- Spock!

736
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.248
- Spock!
- The planet has only seconds left.

737
01:02:26.353 --> 01:02:27.513
We must evacuate.

738
01:02:28.488 --> 01:02:29.819
Mother, now!

739
01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:54.545
<i>- Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
- Locking volume.</i>

<i>Don't move. Stay right where you are.</i>

741
01:03:03.223 --> 01:03:07.216
Transport in five, four, three, two...

742
01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:11.858
- Mother!
- I'm losing her!

743
01:03:12.098 --> 01:03:13.963
I'm losing her! I'm losing her!

744
01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:16.160
No! I lost her. I lost her.

01:05:16.823 --> 01:05:18.120
I'm sorry.

756
01:05:20.593 --> 01:05:21.890
I'm sorry.

757
01:05:23.763 --> 01:05:25.230
I'm so sorry.

758
01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:41.304
What do you need? Tell me.

759
01:05:42.282 --> 01:05:43.510
Tell me.

760
01:05:52.058 --> 01:05:57.086
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

761
01:06:05.038 --> 01:06:06.096
Okay.

762
01:06:25.024 --> 01:06:27.686
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

763
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:30.329
I only have one for you.

764
01:06:31.998 --> 01:06:36.332
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

765
01:06:36.436 --> 01:06:38.996
specifically those surrounding Earth.

766
01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.971
Christopher, answer my question.

767
01:06:44.077 --> 01:06:46.136
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

768
01:06:46.246 --> 01:06:49.044
- against a peaceful planet.
- No, I prevented genocide.

769
01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:57.916
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

770
01:06:58.024 --> 01:07:00.925
I chose a life of honest labor

771
01:07:01.027 --> 01:07:05.225
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

772
01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:09.995
I was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing

773
01:07:10.103 --> 01:07:13.470
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

774
01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.473
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us!

775
01:07:16.576 --> 01:07:18.441
No, you're confused.

776
01:07:18.544 --> 01:07:20.705
You've been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

777
01:07:20.813 --> 01:07:22.246
It's out there right now.

778
01:07:22.348 --> 01:07:24.339
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

779
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.315
It has happened! I watched it happen!

780
01:07:26.419 --> 01:07:29.479
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

781
01:07:33.593 --> 01:07:37.893
And when I lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

782
01:07:38.798 --> 01:07:42.928
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

783
01:07:43.036 --> 01:07:45.800
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

784
01:07:46.773 --> 01:07:48.968
But I did not forget the pain.

785
01:07:50.443 --> 01:07:53.879
It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

786
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:57.813
My purpose, Christopher,

787
01:07:57.917 --> 01:08:01.546
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

788
01:08:03.256 --> 01:08:07.750
but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

789
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.424
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

790
01:08:14.867 --> 01:08:19.270
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

791
01:08:19.372 --> 01:08:21.272
starting with yours.

792
01:08:22.108 --> 01:08:24.702
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

793
01:08:28.781 --> 01:08:31.978
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defenses.

794
01:08:34.854 --> 01:08:36.446
Centaurian slugs.

795
01:08:37.623 --> 01:08:39.853
They latch on to your brain stem

796
01:08:41.027 --> 01:08:44.190
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

797
01:08:45.098 --> 01:08:47.066
Frequencies, please, sir.

798
01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:49.994
<i>Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...</i>

799
01:08:50.103 --> 01:08:51.502
As you wish.

800
01:08:59.145 --> 01:09:01.010
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

801
01:09:01.114 --> 01:09:04.208
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

802
01:09:04.317 --> 01:09:06.979
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Earth may be his next stop,

803
01:09:07.086 --> 01:09:09.919
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

804
01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:11.489
Out of the chair.

805
01:09:11.591 --> 01:09:15.789
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

806
01:09:15.895 --> 01:09:18.557
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

807
01:09:18.664 --> 01:09:20.256
That is not it.

808
01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:21.799
He said he wanted me
to see something,

809
01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:23.300
the destruction of my home planet.

810
01:09:23.403 --> 01:09:25.462
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

811
01:09:25.571 --> 01:09:27.539
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

812
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.437
The engineering comprehension
necessary

813
01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:33.000
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

814
01:09:33.112 --> 01:09:35.410
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

815
01:09:35.515 --> 01:09:37.642
to create a tunnel through space-time.

816
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.775
Damn it, man,
I'm a doctor, not a physicist.

817
01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:41.513
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

818
01:09:41.621 --> 01:09:44.613
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable,

819
01:09:44.724 --> 01:09:46.817
- must be the truth.
- How poetic.

820
01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:50.692
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

821
01:09:50.797 --> 01:09:53.288
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

822
01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.060
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

823
01:09:55.168 --> 01:09:57.136
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

824
01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.329
We are technologically outmatched
in every way.

825
01:09:59.439 --> 01:10:01.566
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

826
01:10:01.674 --> 01:10:04.438
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

827
01:10:04.544 --> 01:10:06.637
Then what about
assigning engineering crews

828
01:10:06.746 --> 01:10:09.112
- to try and boost our warp yield?
- Remaining crew are repairing

829
01:10:09.215 --> 01:10:11.080
- radiation leaks on the lower decks...
- Okay! All right!

830
01:10:11.184 --> 01:10:12.913
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which

831
01:10:13.019 --> 01:10:14.748
- we cannot contact Starfleet.
- There's got to be some way...

832
01:10:14.854 --> 01:10:17.186
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet

833
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.019
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

834
01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:20.649
There won't be a next engagement.

835
01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.661
By the time we've gathered,
it'll be too late.

836
01:10:23.763 --> 01:10:26.163
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's gonna happen?

837
01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.392
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

838
01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:32.062
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

839
01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:34.901
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

840
01:10:35.041 --> 01:10:36.633
<i>beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin,</i>

841
01:10:36.742 --> 01:10:37.731
culminating in the events of today,

842
01:10:37.844 --> 01:10:40.278
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

843
01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:43.109
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

844
01:10:43.216 --> 01:10:44.740
An alternate reality.

845
01:10:45.685 --> 01:10:46.853
Precisely.

846
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.513
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

847
01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:54.183
our destinies have changed.

848
01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.761
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

849
01:10:56.863 --> 01:10:58.125
Spock, don't do that.

850
01:10:58.231 --> 01:11:01.997
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive waste of time.

851
01:11:02.101 --> 01:11:04.262
These are the orders issued
by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

852
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.167
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

853
01:11:06.272 --> 01:11:07.739
Spock, you are Captain now.
You have to make...

854
01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.273
I am aware of my responsibilities,
Mr. Kirk.

855
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:11.741
Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

856
01:11:11.844 --> 01:11:13.812
That is correct, and why
I'm instructing you to accept the fact

857
01:11:13.913 --> 01:11:16.438
- that I alone am in command.
- I will not allow us to go backwards...

858
01:11:16.549 --> 01:11:18.141
- Jim, he's the Captain!
... away from the problem,

859
01:11:18.251 --> 01:11:21.778
- instead of hunting Nero down!
- Security, escort him out.

860
01:11:28.294 --> 01:11:31.457
- Hey!
- Enough, Jim!

861
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.065
Get him off this ship.

862
01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.244
<i>- Computer, where am I?
- Location, Delta Vega.</i>

863
01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:04.442
<i>Class-M planet. Unsafe.</i>

864
01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:07.816
<i>There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometers to the northwest.</i>

865
01:12:08.122 --> 01:12:09.111
<i>Remain in your pod</i>

866
01:12:09.223 --> 01:12:11.817
<i>- until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.
- You gotta be kidding me.</i>

867
01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:57.666
Stardate 2258.42.

868
01:12:58.405 --> 01:13:02.273
Or 44. Whatever.

869
01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:06.005
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

870
01:13:06.113 --> 01:13:10.675
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

871
01:13:10.784 --> 01:13:13.014
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

872
01:15:23.884 --> 01:15:25.351
James T. Kirk.

873
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:30.153
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

874
01:15:32.192 --> 01:15:34.160
How do you know my name?

875
01:15:35.262 --> 01:15:38.891
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

876
01:15:43.303 --> 01:15:47.262
- Look, I don't know you.
- I am Spock.

877
01:15:52.212 --> 01:15:53.201
Bullshit.

878
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.111
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

879
01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:59.777
Especially after the events of today.

880
01:16:01.688 --> 01:16:03.747
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today,

881
01:16:03.857 --> 01:16:07.691
but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

882
01:16:07.794 --> 01:16:10.285
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

883
01:16:10.397 --> 01:16:12.297
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

884
01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:14.333
You are not the captain?

885
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:22.767
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

886
01:16:24.244 --> 01:16:25.438
By Nero.

887
01:16:31.418 --> 01:16:33.511
What do you know about him?

888
01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:36.514
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

889
01:16:37.858 --> 01:16:43.296
- Please, allow me. It will be easier.
- What are you doing?

890
01:16:43.397 --> 01:16:45.991
Our minds, one and together.

891
01:16:48.802 --> 01:16:51.202
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

892
01:16:51.304 --> 01:16:55.331
a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

893
01:16:56.510 --> 01:17:00.105
<i>That is where I'm from, Jim, the future.</i>

894
01:17:04.584 --> 01:17:10.682
<i>A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.</i>

895
01:17:11.425 --> 01:17:14.861
<i>I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.</i>

896
01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.395
<i>We outfitted our fastest ship.</i>

897
01:17:23.837 --> 01:17:26.271
<i>Using red matter,
I would create a black hole</i>

898
01:17:26.373 --> 01:17:28.307
<i>which would absorb the exploding star.</i>

899
01:17:30.143 --> 01:17:32.941
<i>I was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.</i>

900
01:17:34.448 --> 01:17:37.474
<i>The supernova destroyed Romulus.</i>

901
01:17:43.323 --> 01:17:44.950
<i>I had little time.</i>

902
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:51.529
<i>I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.</i>

903
01:18:08.348 --> 01:18:10.782
<i>As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.</i>

904
01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:15.019
<i>He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.</i>

905
01:18:15.589 --> 01:18:19.685
<i>In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.</i>

906
01:18:27.634 --> 01:18:31.092
<i>Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.</i>

907
01:18:37.177 --> 01:18:41.773
<i>Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.</i>

908
01:18:41.882 --> 01:18:43.941
<i>But what was years for Nero</i>

909
01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:47.419
<i>was only seconds for me.</i>

910
01:18:48.488 --> 01:18:50.615
<i>I went through the black hole.</i>

911
01:18:52.826 --> 01:18:55.158
<i>Nero was waiting for me.</i>

912
01:19:01.001 --> 01:19:04.129
<i>He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.</i>

913
01:19:06.006 --> 01:19:08.702
<i>He captured my vessel
and spared my life,</i>

914
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:11.500
<i>for one reason.</i>

915
01:19:12.579 --> 01:19:14.877
<i>So that I would know his pain.</i>

916
01:19:16.917 --> 01:19:20.785
<i>He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.</i>

917
01:19:22.455 --> 01:19:25.117
<i>As he was helpless to save his planet,</i>

918
01:19:25.759 --> 01:19:28.523
<i>I would be helpless to save mine.</i>

919
01:19:31.698 --> 01:19:35.657
<i>Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.</i>

920
01:19:36.503 --> 01:19:38.630
<i>Because I failed.</i>

921
01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:45.167
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

922
01:19:52.786 --> 01:19:55.380
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

923
01:19:56.223 --> 01:19:59.249
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

924
01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:02.459
Jim, we must go.

925
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:06.222
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

926
01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:11.035
Wait. Where you came from,

927
01:20:13.707 --> 01:20:15.436
did I know my father?

928
01:20:16.643 --> 01:20:17.667
Yes.

929
01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:22.641
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

930
01:20:22.782 --> 01:20:26.479
<i>He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.</i>

931
01:20:27.153 --> 01:20:28.415
Captain?

932
01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:31.649
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

933
01:20:39.933 --> 01:20:42.299
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

934
01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:45.030
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

935
01:20:45.138 --> 01:20:48.539
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor.

936
01:20:49.943 --> 01:20:52.241
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

937
01:20:52.345 --> 01:20:55.212
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

938
01:20:55.382 --> 01:20:56.940
Is that a thank-you?

939
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:59.712
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

940
01:20:59.819 --> 01:21:01.582
Permission to speak freely, sir.

941
01:21:03.089 --> 01:21:06.525
- I welcome it.
- Do you? Okay, then.

942
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.260
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

943
01:21:09.362 --> 01:21:11.830
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

944
01:21:11.931 --> 01:21:13.694
Probably. But the right one?

945
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.233
You know, back home we got a saying,

946
01:21:15.335 --> 01:21:16.734
"If you're gonna ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

947
01:21:16.836 --> 01:21:19.134
"you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable. "

948
01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:20.501
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

949
01:21:20.607 --> 01:21:24.941
as a stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

950
01:21:25.045 --> 01:21:27.343
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision!

951
01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:28.709
I intend to assist in the effort

952
01:21:28.815 --> 01:21:31.375
to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

953
01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:35.351
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

954
01:21:35.455 --> 01:21:38.424
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

955
01:21:39.693 --> 01:21:40.990
Excuse me.

956
01:21:45.432 --> 01:21:46.865
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

957
01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:25.631
Hello!

958
01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:09.406
What?

959
01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:15.384
You realize how unacceptable this is?

960
01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:16.887
- Fascinating.
- What?

961
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:18.423
Okay, I'm sure you're just
doing your job,

962
01:23:18.525 --> 01:23:20.322
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

963
01:23:20.427 --> 01:23:21.655
Six months I've been here,

964
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.855
living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal!

965
01:23:25.064 --> 01:23:27.658
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

966
01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:29.632
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

967
01:23:29.736 --> 01:23:31.601
For something
that was clearly an accident.

968
01:23:31.704 --> 01:23:34.502
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

969
01:23:34.607 --> 01:23:36.666
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

970
01:23:36.776 --> 01:23:39.904
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

971
01:23:40.013 --> 01:23:42.641
- Me.
- Get aff! Shut up!

972
01:23:42.749 --> 01:23:45.115
You don't eat anything!
You can eat, like, a bean,

973
01:23:45.218 --> 01:23:48.676
and you're done.
I'm talking about food. Real food.

974
01:23:48.788 --> 01:23:51.188
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

975
01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:53.191
You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott

976
01:23:53.293 --> 01:23:55.488
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

977
01:23:55.595 --> 01:23:58.860
That's what I'm talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

978
01:23:58.965 --> 01:24:00.432
I had a little debate with my instructor

979
01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:04.629
on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

980
01:24:04.737 --> 01:24:08.639
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

981
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:10.231
was limited to about 100 miles.

982
01:24:10.343 --> 01:24:13.039
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

983
01:24:13.146 --> 01:24:15.114
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

984
01:24:15.215 --> 01:24:16.876
which is easy, by the way,

985
01:24:16.983 --> 01:24:18.382
I could do it with a life-form.

986
01:24:18.485 --> 01:24:21.648
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

987
01:24:21.754 --> 01:24:25.383
- I know that dog. What happened to it?
- I'll tell you when it reappears.

988
01:24:25.492 --> 01:24:27.357
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

989
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.327
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

990
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:33.661
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is traveling at warp speed?

991
01:24:33.766 --> 01:24:36.257
I think if that equation had been
discovered, I'd have heard about it.

992
01:24:36.369 --> 01:24:38.234
The reason you haven't heard of it,
Mr. Scott,

993
01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:41.136
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

994
01:24:46.145 --> 01:24:49.478
- Are you from the future?
- Yeah, he is. I'm not.

995
01:24:50.283 --> 01:24:52.877
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

996
01:24:53.052 --> 01:24:54.679
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

997
01:24:54.787 --> 01:24:58.655
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

998
01:24:58.758 --> 01:24:59.850
On youse go.

999
01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:02.985
<i>So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?</i>

1000
01:25:03.096 --> 01:25:04.757
She is one well-endowed lady.

1001
01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:06.855
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1002
01:25:06.966 --> 01:25:09.730
if you'll pardon
the engineering parlance.

1003
01:25:10.737 --> 01:25:13.399
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right,

1004
01:25:13.506 --> 01:25:16.998
where you're from, what I've done,
which I don't, by the way,

1005
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:19.578
<i>you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise</i>

1006
01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:22.512
while she's traveling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1007
01:25:22.615 --> 01:25:25.413
Get off there! It's not a climbing frame.

1008
01:25:25.518 --> 01:25:30.148
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1009
01:25:30.256 --> 01:25:33.123
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1010
01:25:33.226 --> 01:25:34.215
What's that?

1011
01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:37.387
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1012
01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:41.189
Get out of it.

1013
01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:46.263
Imagine that!

1014
01:25:46.372 --> 01:25:49.535
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1015
01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:51.940
You're coming with us, right?

1016
01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.209
- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
- Your...

1017
01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:00.378
He... The other Spock
is not gonna believe me.

1018
01:26:00.486 --> 01:26:01.578
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened.

1019
01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:04.418
Under no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1020
01:26:04.524 --> 01:26:05.582
You must promise me this.

1021
01:26:05.692 --> 01:26:08.820
You're telling me I can't tell you
that I'm following your own orders?

1022
01:26:08.928 --> 01:26:12.489
- Why not? What happens?
- Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1023
01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:16.091
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

1024
01:26:16.235 --> 01:26:19.261
- How? Over your dead body?
- Preferably not.

1025
01:26:19.372 --> 01:26:22.364
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1026
01:26:22.475 --> 01:26:25.638
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer

1027
01:26:25.745 --> 01:26:28.805
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand

1028
01:26:28.915 --> 01:26:30.883
must resign said command.

1029
01:26:33.119 --> 01:26:37.215
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1030
01:26:37.323 --> 01:26:40.315
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1031
01:26:41.527 --> 01:26:44.428
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

1032
01:26:45.398 --> 01:26:48.162
What you must do is get me to show it.

1033
01:26:48.267 --> 01:26:51.759
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1034
01:26:56.242 --> 01:26:59.234
No, go. You cannae come with me.
Go on.

1035
01:27:01.014 --> 01:27:03.778
You know, coming back in time,
changing history,

1036
01:27:04.317 --> 01:27:05.750
that's cheating.

1037
01:27:07.987 --> 01:27:10.251
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1038
01:27:19.165 --> 01:27:21.861
Live long and prosper.

1039
01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:43.454
Mr. Scott!

1040
01:27:48.628 --> 01:27:50.858
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

1041
01:27:58.504 --> 01:28:00.131
Hold on a second!

1042
01:28:01.007 --> 01:28:01.996
Oh, no.

1043
01:28:05.645 --> 01:28:07.237
Don't worry, I...

1044
01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:19.081
No. No!

1045
01:28:38.945 --> 01:28:41.436
<i>Turbine release valve activated.</i>

1046
01:28:48.154 --> 01:28:50.588
You all right? You all right?

1047
01:28:52.725 --> 01:28:55.159
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1048
01:28:55.394 --> 01:29:01.264
Captain Spock! Detecting unauthorized
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

1049
01:29:01.367 --> 01:29:02.527
Bring up the video.

1050
01:29:06.773 --> 01:29:08.400
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1051
01:29:08.508 --> 01:29:11.375
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1052
01:29:11.544 --> 01:29:12.602
Set phasers to stun.

1053
01:29:24.657 --> 01:29:26.147
- Halt!
- No, no!

1054
01:29:30.096 --> 01:29:32.894
Come with me, cupcake!

1055
01:29:41.207 --> 01:29:42.231
- Who are you?
- I'm with him.

1056
01:29:42.341 --> 01:29:44.673
- He's with me.
- We are traveling at warp speed.

1057
01:29:44.777 --> 01:29:46.335
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1058
01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:47.639
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1059
01:29:47.747 --> 01:29:50.875
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

1060
01:29:50.983 --> 01:29:53.975
Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain.

1061
01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.544
What, did...

1062
01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:58.715
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1063
01:29:58.825 --> 01:30:01.385
- That doesn't make you angry.
- Are you a member of Starfleet?

1064
01:30:01.494 --> 01:30:03.860
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1065
01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:06.124
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me

1066
01:30:06.232 --> 01:30:08.564
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1067
01:30:08.668 --> 01:30:10.101
- Well...
- Don't answer him.

1068
01:30:10.203 --> 01:30:11.898
You will answer me.

1069
01:30:13.673 --> 01:30:17.131
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1070
01:30:19.078 --> 01:30:21.444
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered,

1071
01:30:21.547 --> 01:30:24.641
- and you're not even upset.
- If you are presuming

1072
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:27.719
that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship,

1073
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.549
- you are mistaken.
- And yet, you are the one

1074
01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:32.453
who said fear was necessary
for command.

1075
01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:35.959
I mean, did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1076
01:30:36.495 --> 01:30:38.554
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1077
01:30:38.664 --> 01:30:40.894
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1078
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.161
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

1079
01:30:43.269 --> 01:30:46.568
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1080
01:30:47.206 --> 01:30:48.332
Or the need to stop at nothing

1081
01:30:48.441 --> 01:30:50.432
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1082
01:30:50.576 --> 01:30:52.476
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1083
01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:54.739
It must not even compute for you.

1084
01:30:55.514 --> 01:30:56.572
You never loved her!

1085
01:31:21.641 --> 01:31:22.767
Spock!

1086
01:32:00.279 --> 01:32:02.804
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1087
01:32:03.215 --> 01:32:04.739
I hereby relinquish my command,

1088
01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:08.877
based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

1089
01:32:08.988 --> 01:32:12.048
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1090
01:32:37.984 --> 01:32:41.545
I like this ship! You know, it's exciting!

1091
01:32:44.323 --> 01:32:45.790
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1092
01:32:45.925 --> 01:32:50.225
Now we've got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1093
01:32:51.297 --> 01:32:52.423
Yeah, we do.

1094
01:32:53.065 --> 01:32:55.590
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1095
01:32:55.735 --> 01:32:58.795
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1096
01:33:01.774 --> 01:33:05.232
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1097
01:33:07.046 --> 01:33:08.445
So do I.

1098
01:33:13.085 --> 01:33:15.451
<i>Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.</i>

1099
01:33:17.123 --> 01:33:21.253
<i>Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.</i>

1100
01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:25.094
<i>I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,</i>

1101
01:33:25.197 --> 01:33:27.563
<i>but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.</i>

1102
01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:30.897
<i>I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.</i>

1103
01:33:31.337 --> 01:33:35.034
Either we're going down or they are.

1104
01:33:36.642 --> 01:33:37.870
Kirk out.

1105
01:33:45.351 --> 01:33:47.216
Speak your mind, Spock.

1106
01:33:50.156 --> 01:33:51.817
That would be unwise.

1107
01:33:52.525 --> 01:33:55.926
What is necessary is never unwise.

1108
01:33:57.263 --> 01:34:00.460
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1109
01:34:02.401 --> 01:34:05.199
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1110
01:34:07.006 --> 01:34:08.906
I am grateful for this.

1111
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:12.275
And for you.

1112
01:34:14.246 --> 01:34:17.477
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

1113
01:34:18.884 --> 01:34:21.045
An anger I cannot control.

1114
01:34:25.324 --> 01:34:30.284
I believe that she would say,

1115
01:34:31.864 --> 01:34:33.388
"Do not try to. "

1116
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.669
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1117
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:45.870
I married her because I loved her.

1118
01:34:54.086 --> 01:34:56.816
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1119
01:34:56.922 --> 01:34:59.322
We can't just go in there guns blazing,
Jim, not with their technology.

1120
01:34:59.425 --> 01:35:01.552
I'm telling you, the math doesn't support
what you're suggesting.

1121
01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.787
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!
- Yes, Mr. Chekov. What is it?

1122
01:35:03.896 --> 01:35:05.989
<i>Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan,</i>

1123
01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:09.329
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1124
01:35:09.435 --> 01:35:12.700
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1125
01:35:12.805 --> 01:35:15.137
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1126
01:35:15.241 --> 01:35:19.871
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

1127
01:35:19.979 --> 01:35:22.573
the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings

1128
01:35:22.681 --> 01:35:24.876
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1129
01:35:25.017 --> 01:35:27.349
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated,

1130
01:35:27.453 --> 01:35:30.616
- we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
- Aye, that might work.

1131
01:35:31.357 --> 01:35:32.915
Wait a minute, kid. How old are you?

1132
01:35:33.025 --> 01:35:35.721
- Seventeen, sir.
- Oh, good, he's 17.

1133
01:35:35.828 --> 01:35:37.455
Doctor.

1134
01:35:37.563 --> 01:35:40.964
Mr. Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

1135
01:35:41.367 --> 01:35:43.301
If Mr. Sulu is able
to maneuver us into position,

1136
01:35:43.402 --> 01:35:46.132
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1137
01:35:46.238 --> 01:35:49.002
and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

1138
01:35:49.108 --> 01:35:51.770
I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock.

1139
01:35:51.877 --> 01:35:54.903
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1140
01:35:55.014 --> 01:35:57.039
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1141
01:35:57.149 --> 01:36:00.277
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1142
01:36:01.654 --> 01:36:03.622
Also, my mother was human,

1143
01:36:03.722 --> 01:36:06.714
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1144
01:36:12.965 --> 01:36:15.058
Then I'm coming with you.

1145
01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:19.194
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1146
01:36:20.973 --> 01:36:23.737
See? We are
getting to know each other.

1147
01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:40.850
Prepare the drill.

1148
01:36:57.142 --> 01:37:02.637
All stop in three, two, one.

1149
01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.780
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1150
01:37:10.889 --> 01:37:12.754
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1151
01:37:12.858 --> 01:37:15.053
- Aye.
- Fire.

1152
01:37:42.354 --> 01:37:45.050
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

1153
01:37:45.157 --> 01:37:47.591
Really? Fine job, Mr. Sulu. Well done.

1154
01:37:48.794 --> 01:37:52.560
- How are we, Scotty? - Unbelievably,
sir, the ship is in position.

1155
01:37:55.768 --> 01:37:57.861
Whatever happens, Mr. Sulu,

1156
01:37:57.970 --> 01:37:59.665
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1157
01:37:59.772 --> 01:38:03.333
you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

1158
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:06.036
Yes, sir.

1159
01:38:06.145 --> 01:38:10.138
<i>Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.</i>

1160
01:38:10.282 --> 01:38:11.442
Good luck.

1161
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:27.331
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1162
01:38:29.134 --> 01:38:32.103
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1163
01:38:48.954 --> 01:38:51.718
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1164
01:38:51.824 --> 01:38:53.689
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense

1165
01:38:53.792 --> 01:38:55.054
in the design of the enemy ship,

1166
01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.094
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1167
01:38:57.196 --> 01:38:59.892
- Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
- Energize.

1168
01:39:43.208 --> 01:39:45.574
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1169
01:39:45.978 --> 01:39:48.037
<i>- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.</i>

1170
01:39:52.851 --> 01:39:53.909
Ayel!

1171
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:09.860
I'll cover you.

1172
01:40:10.369 --> 01:40:12.269
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, I got you.

1173
01:40:32.124 --> 01:40:35.389
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

1174
01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:38.921
And Captain Pike.

1175
01:41:01.687 --> 01:41:02.881
Move!

1176
01:41:03.422 --> 01:41:05.481
They have activated the drill.

1177
01:41:06.692 --> 01:41:08.284
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1178
01:41:08.393 --> 01:41:09.860
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1179
01:41:09.962 --> 01:41:11.589
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1180
01:41:11.697 --> 01:41:13.255
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1181
01:41:32.518 --> 01:41:33.883
I foresee a complication.

1182
01:41:33.986 --> 01:41:36.580
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1183
01:41:36.688 --> 01:41:39.680
<i>Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.</i>

1184
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:41.884
<i>Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.</i>

1185
01:41:41.994 --> 01:41:43.484
Wow, that's weird.

1186
01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:47.463
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1187
01:41:47.566 --> 01:41:52.003
<i>Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.</i>

1188
01:41:54.973 --> 01:41:57.533
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1189
01:41:57.643 --> 01:41:59.634
You're gonna be able
to fly this thing, right?

1190
01:41:59.745 --> 01:42:02.179
Something tells me I already have.

1191
01:42:02.814 --> 01:42:04.338
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1192
01:42:05.551 --> 01:42:08.884
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1193
01:42:08.987 --> 01:42:11.012
- It'll work.
- In the event that I do not return,

1194
01:42:11.123 --> 01:42:13.114
- please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
- Spock!

1195
01:42:13.225 --> 01:42:14.920
It'll work.

1196
01:42:24.736 --> 01:42:26.203
Fascinating.

1197
01:42:34.846 --> 01:42:36.837
<i>Start-up sequence initiated.</i>

1198
01:43:21.159 --> 01:43:23.184
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1199
01:43:33.872 --> 01:43:36.841
I know your face from Earth's history.

1200
01:44:21.953 --> 01:44:25.445
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1201
01:44:25.557 --> 01:44:27.923
<i>He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

1202
01:44:28.026 --> 01:44:29.357
But that was another life.

1203
01:44:30.228 --> 01:44:33.288
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1204
01:45:05.897 --> 01:45:10.095
<i>Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship has been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.</i>

1205
01:45:10.535 --> 01:45:11.502
Spock!

1206
01:45:13.338 --> 01:45:14.862
Spock!

1207
01:45:32.524 --> 01:45:33.923
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir!

1208
01:45:35.727 --> 01:45:38.662
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1209
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.989
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1210
01:45:41.099 --> 01:45:42.225
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1211
01:45:42.467 --> 01:45:44.435
<i>- No terms. No deals.
- That ship, take it out.</i>

1212
01:45:44.536 --> 01:45:45.730
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1213
01:45:45.837 --> 01:45:47.270
- you'll destroy...
- I want Spock dead now!

1214
01:46:03.255 --> 01:46:05.052
- He went to warp, sir.
- Go after him!

1215
01:46:05.157 --> 01:46:06.385
Yes, sir!

1216
01:46:36.588 --> 01:46:39.614
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1217
01:46:41.026 --> 01:46:43.085
- I can't...
- You can't what?

1218
01:46:43.261 --> 01:46:44.785
You can't even speak.

1219
01:46:47.399 --> 01:46:50.129
- What?
- I got your gun.

1220
01:47:16.862 --> 01:47:17.920
What's he doing?

1221
01:47:18.396 --> 01:47:21.263
<i>Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.</i>

1222
01:47:22.067 --> 01:47:23.056
Fire everything!

1223
01:47:30.442 --> 01:47:34.640
<i>Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.</i>

1224
01:47:34.779 --> 01:47:36.144
Understood.

1225
01:47:42.487 --> 01:47:43.977
Captain, I've picked up another ship!

1226
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:08.938
- What are you doing here?
- Just following orders.

1227
01:48:28.833 --> 01:48:29.925
<i>Enterprise, now!</i>

1228
01:48:53.358 --> 01:48:55.087
Nice timing, Scotty!

1229
01:48:56.027 --> 01:48:59.963
I've never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before!

1230
01:49:00.065 --> 01:49:01.896
- Jim!
- Bones!

1231
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.627
I got him.

1232
01:49:05.837 --> 01:49:06.861
That was pretty good!

1233
01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:11.403
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power! Their shields are down, sir.

1234
01:49:11.509 --> 01:49:12.908
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1235
01:49:48.113 --> 01:49:50.946
<i>This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

1236
01:49:51.416 --> 01:49:52.747
Your ship is compromised.

1237
01:49:52.851 --> 01:49:55.342
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1238
01:49:55.453 --> 01:49:57.250
which we are willing to provide.

1239
01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:03.025
- Captain, what are you doing?
- Showing them compassion

1240
01:50:03.128 --> 01:50:04.823
may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

1241
01:50:04.929 --> 01:50:07.921
It's logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

1242
01:50:08.033 --> 01:50:10.729
No, not really. Not this time.

1243
01:50:10.835 --> 01:50:15.295
<i>I would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.</i>

1244
01:50:15.407 --> 01:50:19.639
<i>I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.</i>

1245
01:50:19.744 --> 01:50:21.541
You got it.

1246
01:50:21.646 --> 01:50:24.479
- Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.
- Yes, sir.

1247
01:51:09.694 --> 01:51:11.958
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir!

1248
01:51:23.341 --> 01:51:25.332
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1249
01:51:25.443 --> 01:51:27.638
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1250
01:51:27.745 --> 01:51:29.076
You bet your ass, Captain!

1251
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:34.775
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!
It's got us!

1252
01:51:34.886 --> 01:51:38.344
- Go to maximum warp! Push it!
- I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!

1253
01:51:47.732 --> 01:51:49.165
All she's got isn't good enough!

1254
01:51:49.267 --> 01:51:52.634
<i>- What else you got?
- Okay, if we eject the core and detonate,</i>

1255
01:51:52.737 --> 01:51:53.999
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1256
01:51:54.105 --> 01:51:55.265
I cannae promise anything, though!

1257
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:00.343
Do it, do it, do it!

1258
01:52:01.579 --> 01:52:03.376
- Clear the area! Go!
- Yes, sir!

1259
01:53:30.969 --> 01:53:32.527
Father!

1260
01:53:40.912 --> 01:53:42.641
I am not our father.

1261
01:53:50.321 --> 01:53:54.951
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1262
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:59.255
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1263
01:53:59.364 --> 01:54:01.264
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1264
01:54:01.366 --> 01:54:04.802
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you

1265
01:54:04.902 --> 01:54:07.530
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1266
01:54:07.639 --> 01:54:12.804
of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realize.

1267
01:54:14.746 --> 01:54:16.839
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1268
01:54:16.948 --> 01:54:20.315
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1269
01:54:20.418 --> 01:54:22.818
- should he break his promise.
- You lied.

1270
01:54:24.289 --> 01:54:26.382
I... I implied.

1271
01:54:26.958 --> 01:54:28.949
- A gamble.
- An act of faith.

1272
01:54:30.061 --> 01:54:33.224
One I hope that you'll repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1273
01:54:33.331 --> 01:54:34.958
In the face of extinction,
it is only logical

1274
01:54:35.066 --> 01:54:37.762
I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1275
01:54:37.869 --> 01:54:40.133
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

1276
01:54:41.472 --> 01:54:44.168
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1277
01:54:44.642 --> 01:54:48.942
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1278
01:54:49.047 --> 01:54:52.744
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor.

1279
01:54:54.285 --> 01:54:57.516
Put aside logic. Do what feels right.

1280
01:55:03.428 --> 01:55:07.091
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1281
01:55:07.198 --> 01:55:08.426
I shall simply say

1282
01:55:09.534 --> 01:55:10.933
good luck.

1283
01:55:21.879 --> 01:55:25.542
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1284
01:55:26.217 --> 01:55:29.584
Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1285
01:55:29.687 --> 01:55:32.349
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1286
01:55:32.457 --> 01:55:37.258
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1287
01:55:38.329 --> 01:55:41.264
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1288
01:55:45.970 --> 01:55:47.938
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1289
01:55:48.039 --> 01:55:52.100
<i>you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1290
01:55:52.210 --> 01:55:53.905
for duty as his relief.

1291
01:56:02.854 --> 01:56:04.549
I relieve you, sir.

1292
01:56:04.989 --> 01:56:06.786
I am relieved.

1293
01:56:08.626 --> 01:56:11.151
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

1294
01:56:13.131 --> 01:56:14.962
Your father would be proud.

1295
01:56:44.462 --> 01:56:46.089
Thrusters on full.

1296
01:56:46.697 --> 01:56:49.461
Maneuvering thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1297
01:56:49.634 --> 01:56:52.228
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1298
01:56:52.336 --> 01:56:54.930
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1299
01:56:59.477 --> 01:57:02.275
Bones! Buckle up.

1300
01:57:06.851 --> 01:57:08.318
Scotty, how we doing?

1301
01:57:08.419 --> 01:57:11.081
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1302
01:57:12.156 --> 01:57:13.555
Get down!

1303
01:57:15.593 --> 01:57:18.494
Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

1304
01:57:21.532 --> 01:57:23.932
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1305
01:57:24.335 --> 01:57:26.064
Permission granted.

1306
01:57:26.838 --> 01:57:28.897
As you have yet to select a first officer,

1307
01:57:29.006 --> 01:57:32.032
respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

1308
01:57:32.643 --> 01:57:36.010
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1309
01:57:36.514 --> 01:57:38.778
It would be my honor, Commander.

1310
01:57:42.487 --> 01:57:44.887
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

1311
01:57:46.657 --> 01:57:48.522
Thrusters on standby.

1312
01:57:48.626 --> 01:57:50.924
- Take us out.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

1313
01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:59.131
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1314
01:58:00.972 --> 01:58:04.430
<i>These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.</i>

1315
01:58:05.476 --> 01:58:09.276
<i>Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1316
01:58:10.047 --> 01:58:13.847
<i>to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations,</i>

1317
01:58:14.318 --> 01:58:18.846
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>
