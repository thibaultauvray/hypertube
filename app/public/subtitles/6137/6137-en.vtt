1
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.605
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk

2
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.887
of the United Federation of Planets.

3
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.443
I am appearing before you
as a neutral representative

4
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.204
of the Fibonan Republic.

5
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.848
I bring you a message of goodwill

6
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.487
and present to you esteemed members
of the Teenaxi Delegation,

7
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.049
a gift from the Fibonan High Council
with the highest regard.

8
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.725
What's wrong with it?

9
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.166
Excuse me?

10
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.363
Why don't they want it anymore?

11
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.603
Well, this was once
a piece of an ancient weapon,

12
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.041
and now they offer it as a symbol of...

13
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.640
Of peace.

14
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.326
In the Fibonan culture,

15
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.721
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce.

16
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.165
How did they come by it?

17
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.891
They told me they acquired it
a long time ago.

18
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.650
So they stole it, then.

19
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.283
No, they... Well, I don't know.

20
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.931
You don't know the Fibonans like we do!

21
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.402
Yeah, that's very true.
Your Excellency, this gift...

22
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.086
They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves

23
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640
who want to see us murdered
in our own beds!

24
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.971
This beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace.

25
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.330
They want to chop us into pieces
and roast us over a fire!

26
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.004
No, no... I don't think that's true.

27
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.764
And eat us!

28
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.121
What?

29
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.927
Scotty! Get me out of here!

30
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.729
- That was quick.
- Scotty!

31
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.290
There's quite a bit
of surface interference, sir.

32
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.171
Scotty!

33
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.281
Get it off of me!

34
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.328
I ripped my shirt again.

35
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.640
How'd it go?

36
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.642
Captain, did you manage to broker
a treaty with the Teenaxi?

37
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.331
Let's just say I came up short.

38
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.928
Will you log that and put it in
the vault, Spock? Thank you.

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.684
Jim, you look like crap.

40
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.001
Thank you, Bones.

41
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930
You got that little vein popping out
of your temple again. You okay?

42
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.611
Never better!
Just another day in the fleet.

43
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.206
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2.

44
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.604
Today is our 966th day in deep space,

45
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.843
a little under three years
into our five-year mission.

46
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.008
The more time we spend out here,

47
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.249
the harder it is to tell
where one day ends

48
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.884
and the next one begins.

49
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.047
It can be a challenge to feel grounded
when even gravity is artificial.

50
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.123
But, well, we do what we can
to make it feel like home.

51
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.126
The crew, as always,
continues to act admirably

52
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.841
despite the rigors of our extended stay
here in outer space.

53
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.924
And the personal sacrifices
they have made.

54
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.483
We continue to search for new life forms in
order to establish firm diplomatic ties.

55
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.930
Our extended time in uncharted territory

56
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.287
has stretched the ship's
mechanical capacities.

57
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.687
But fortunately
our engineering department,

58
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.843
led by Mr. Scott,
is more than up to the job.

59
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.801
The ship aside, prolonged cohabitation has

60
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.248
definitely had effects
on interpersonal dynamics.

61
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.561
Some experiences for the better,

62
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.847
and some for the worse.

63
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.808
As for me, things have started to feel
a little episodic.

64
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.250
The farther out we go,
the more I find myself wondering

65
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.641
what it is we're trying to accomplish.

66
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.764
If the universe is truly endless,

67
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.442
then are we not striving for something
forever out of reach?

68
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.687
The Enterprise is scheduled for
a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

69
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.923
the Federation's newest
and most advanced starbase.

70
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.368
Perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite

71
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.125
from the mysteries of the unknown.

72
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.371
Sorry I'm late.

73
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.569
Keenser's leaking some kind of
highly acidic green goo,

74
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.645
and Scotty's terrified he's gonna
sneeze on the warp core and kill us all.

75
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.882
What the hell are you drinking?

76
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.210
I'm pretty sure it's the rest of that
Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus.

77
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.647
My God, man, are you trying to go blind?

78
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.644
That stuff's illegal.

79
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.008
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

80
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.607
- Wow.
- Right?

81
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.364
I mean, I always assumed he'd be

82
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.283
- a vodka man.
- A vodka guy, exactly.

83
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.523
I wanted to have something
appropriate for your birthday.

84
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.366
That's in a couple days.
You know I don't care about that.

85
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.091
I know. I know you don't like
celebrating it on the day

86
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.686
because it's also the day
your pa bit the dust.

87
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.091
I was being sensitive.

88
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.448
Did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school?

89
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.682
It's just your southern charm.

90
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.804
Yeah. That's good.

91
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.881
Lordy!

92
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.563
Are you gonna call your mom?

93
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.366
Yeah, of course. I'll call her on the day.

94
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.010
I'm one year older.

95
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.766
Yep, that's usually how it works.

96
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.480
A year older than he ever got to be.

97
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.407
He joined Starfleet because he...

98
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.205
He believed in it.

99
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.085
I joined on a dare.

100
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.611
You joined to see
if you could live up to him.

101
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.566
You spent all this time
trying to be George Kirk

102
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.129
and now you're wondering
just what it means to be Jim.

103
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.084
Why you're out here.

104
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.527
To perfect eyesight
and a full head of hair.

105
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.327
Kirk here.

106
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.243
Captain, approaching Yorktown base.

107
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.209
I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

108
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.525
Let's keep this birthday thing
under wraps?

109
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.251
Yeah, you know me. Mr. Sensitive.

110
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.209
Wow. That is impressive.

111
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.841
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?

112
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.930
What a damn monstrosity!

113
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.722
Couldn't we just rent
some space on a planet?

114
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.247
Showing geographical favoritism
among inducted Federation worlds

115
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.526
could cause diplomatic tension.

116
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.284
You don't think that looks tense?

117
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.648
Looks like a damn snow globe
in space just waiting to break!

118
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.603
That's the spirit, Bones.

119
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.051
Spock!

120
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.530
Do you have a moment?

121
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.485
Of course, Nyota.

122
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.646
I think you should have this back.

123
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.324
After all, it belonged to your mother.

124
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.647
It's not in the Vulcan custom

125
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.769
to receive again that
which was given as a gift.

126
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.891
You guys break up?

127
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.800
What'd you do?

128
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.881
A typically reductive inquiry, Doctor.

129
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.087
You know, Spock, if an Earth girl says
"It's me, not you,"

130
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.004
it's definitely you.

131
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.209
Excuse me. Commander Spock?

132
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.368
May we have a moment of your time?

133
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.603
This is wonderful!
You know I've never been here?

134
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.650
What I hear is that
the bars here are excellent.

135
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.607
I'm so glad you guys could come.

136
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.011
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

137
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.964
Live long and prosper.

138
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.482
Live long and prosper.

139
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.121
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

140
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.762
Unidentified. Non-Federation.

141
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.288
Attention, unidentified vessel.
You are not authorized for approach.

142
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.522
Power down and await instructions.

143
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.442
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

144
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.050
Speak normally.

145
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.410
Language analysis complete.

146
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.970
Is this working?

147
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.963
We were on a science mission
inside the nebula.

148
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.564
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

149
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.481
I took an escape pod

150
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.166
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet.

151
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.847
We need a ship
capable of navigating the nebula.

152
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.444
You must have someone

153
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.485
who can help us.

154
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.606
We tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula,

155
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.684
here at 2-1-0 mark 14.

156
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.606
- Long-range scan?
- No data.

157
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.725
The nebula is too dense.
It's uncharted space.

158
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.526
Well, the Enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet.

159
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.601
She could handle it.

160
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.445
The only ship here with
more advanced technology

161
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.409
is still under construction.

162
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.686
But it's not just the ship
that I'm sending.

163
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.568
- I'll gather the crew.
- Captain.

164
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.765
Starfleet command sent me your application

165
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.969
for the Vice Admiral position
here at this installation.

166
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.851
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.725
If I may, I would

168
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.086
recommend Commander Spock replace
me as Captain of the Enterprise.

169
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.725
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.
He'd make a great captain.

170
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.721
It isn't uncommon, you know,

171
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.765
even for a captain,

172
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.083
to want to leave.

173
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.005
There is no relative direction
in the vastness of space.

174
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.322
There is only yourself,

175
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.484
your ship, your crew.

176
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.086
It's easier than you think, to get lost.

177
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.246
- It's not about...
- I'll bring it up with the General Council.

178
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.482
We'll discuss it when you return.

179
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.407
Ma'am.

180
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.001
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

181
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.089
- I was thinking...
- Perhaps there...

182
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.208
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.

183
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.647
I insist.

184
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.211
After this mission, we should sit down.

185
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.130
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

186
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.328
I as well have something to share.

187
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.403
We make a good team. Right?

188
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.925
I believe we do.

189
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.447
I insist.

190
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.568
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a ship-wide channel.

191
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.005
Yes, Captain.

192
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.248
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

193
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.211
Our mission is straightforward.

194
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.765
Rescue a crew stranded on a planet
in uncharted space.

195
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.044
Our trajectory will take us
through an unstable nebula,

196
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.841
one which will disable
all communications with Starfleet.

197
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.204
We're gonna be on our own.

198
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.481
The Enterprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has,

199
00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.801
you.

200
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.965
And as we've come to understand,
there is no such thing as the unknown,

201
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.443
only the temporarily hidden.

202
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.441
Kirk out.

203
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.450
Readings indicate cloud
density diminishing, sir.

204
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.206
This is Altamid. My ship is stranded here.

205
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.321
Approaching Altamid. Class-M planet.

206
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.490
Massive subterranean development.

207
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.040
But limited to no life forms
on the surface.

208
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.451
Proximity alert, sir!

209
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.409
We have an unknown ship
heading right for us.

210
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.006
- Lieutenant Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.

211
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.649
No response.
I am picking up some kind of signal.

212
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.970
They're jamming us.

213
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.124
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

214
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.805
What is this?

215
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.764
Shields up! Red alert!

216
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.491
Fire at will.

217
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.241
Sir, our phasers are having minimal effect

218
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.482
and our torpedoes
can't track their movements!

219
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.891
Fire everything we've got.

220
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.243
Captain, we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement.

221
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.360
Shield frequencies have no effect, sir!

222
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.330
They took out the dish!
Shields are inoperable!

223
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.720
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.446
Why the hell aren't we moving?

225
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.682
I can't engage the warp drive, sir!

226
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.607
Scotty, I need warp now!

227
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.001
I cannae, sir! The nacelles, they've...

228
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.280
They've gone!

229
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.164
Security, engage all emergency procedures.

230
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.561
Active protocol 28 Code One Alpha Zero.

231
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.808
All personnel to alert stations.

232
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.005
Sir, I have hull breaches
in levels 12 to 15,

233
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.084
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

234
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.607
Captain! There's a chance I can
reroute the energy reserves

235
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.331
from the warp core to the impulse engines.

236
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.767
If we can get back into the nebula,
maybe we could lose them.

237
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.410
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

238
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.482
Wee man! Let's go.

239
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.927
Fit the plasma conduits
and stand by to reroute on my mark!

240
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.201
- Captain.
- Go, Spock.

241
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.520
I have identified the individual

242
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.126
who appears to be
leading the attack party.

243
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.681
He infiltrated the archive vault and removed
the artifact from our mission on Teenax.

244
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.603
Hold your distance until...

245
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.961
Spock!

246
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.321
Spock!

247
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.891
You two, with me. Sulu, you have the conn.

248
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.961
Yes, sir.

249
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.485
My God.

250
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.246
What the hell?

251
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.881
Doctor?

252
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.330
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

253
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.690
Captain

254
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.051
Kirk.

255
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.768
Yes! We are at 100% impulse.

256
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.251
Great work, Mr. Scott!

257
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.084
Maximum impulse towards the nebula.

258
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.161
Aye.

259
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.006
Kirk to Bridge.

260
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.086
We are losing the inertial dampeners!

261
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.728
Systems are failing ship-wide, Captain.

262
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.245
Emergency bulkheads are sealing,

263
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.802
but structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir!

264
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.688
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

265
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.410
Sound the alarm.

266
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.962
Abandon ship. All personnel.

267
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.083
We need to give those pods
a chance to escape.

268
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.685
Can you lead those ships away?

269
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.843
Impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.

270
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.969
We cannot move
until the saucer is separated.

271
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.531
I'll handle it.

272
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.086
Aye-aye, sir.

273
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.690
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately

274
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.007
You okay? Oh, my God.
Get him up. Help him up.

275
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.161
Got you.

276
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.402
We've got to get you guys
to an escape pod. Go.

277
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.766
Go! Ensign Syl.

278
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.365
I need your help.

279
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.526
Yes, sir.

280
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.205
My God.

281
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.482
Spock, they're taking the crew!

282
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.287
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately

283
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.680
Are you okay?

284
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.568
The saucer should be free by now!

285
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.251
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there!

286
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.564
All personnel evacuate immediately

287
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.883
Impulse engines drawing power
from auxiliary generators.

288
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.926
Captain!

289
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.770
How many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer?

290
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.481
None.

291
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.447
But if I'm reading this correctly,
the intruders are taking them.

292
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.526
Captain, we are caught
in the planet's gravity.

293
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.602
We cannot pull away.

294
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.409
Get to your Kelvin Pods.

295
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.364
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, Captain.

296
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.010
Come on, let's go!

297
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.201
Let's go.

298
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.281
Come on.

299
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.161
Chekov!

300
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.687
You knew. You knew we'd be attacked.

301
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.645
You don't understand.

302
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.246
Captain! Captain Kirk!

303
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.527
Yes. I lied.

304
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.291
Our ship was attacked.

305
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.287
Chekov, check the comms for survivors.

306
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.124
- Aye, Captain.
- Who is he?

307
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.410
His name is Krall.

308
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.364
He took my crew. Like he took yours.

309
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.766
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?

310
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.804
All I know is that if I did this,

311
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.565
he would set them free.

312
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.689
Chekov, are you picking
anything up on those scanners?

313
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.050
Nothing, sir.

314
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.961
- What if they...
- No, no.

315
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.165
He was taking them.

316
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.691
We have to find that saucer.

317
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.162
Even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder.

318
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.083
Aye, Captain, it's possible.

319
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.211
Captain.

320
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.007
I was protecting my crew.

321
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.281
What is your name?

322
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.369
How do you know our language?

323
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.887
I know your kind.

324
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.610
I am Lieutenant Nyota Uhura
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

325
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.286
And you have committed
an act of war against the...

326
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.486
Federation!

327
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.969
Federation is an act of war.

328
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.925
You attacked us.

329
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.166
Your captain...

330
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.408
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

331
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.963
He would have done the same.

332
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.569
And if he made it off of that ship,
he will come for us.

333
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.648
I am counting on it, Lieutenant Uhura.

334
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.444
I can't believe it.

335
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.646
My God, Spock.

336
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.521
God...

337
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.884
Sit down over here.

338
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.330
Okay. Okay, sit. Easy.

339
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.166
Okay.

340
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.891
Now, just try and relax.
You're gonna be okay.

341
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.049
The forced optimism in your voice suggests

342
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.282
that you are trying
to elicit a sense of calm in order to...

343
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.521
I'll cut the horseshit.

344
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.080
Doctor, I fail to see
how excrement of any kind

345
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.527
bears relevance on our current situation.

346
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.721
What the hell are you doing?

347
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.926
We must keep moving, Doctor.

348
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.843
Spock, this thing's punctured
your iliac region!

349
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.921
Time is a critical factor.

350
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.729
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.

351
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.768
Look, if I can't take this out,
you're gonna die.

352
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.162
Okay? If I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you're gonna die.

353
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.123
I can see no appeal in either option.

354
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.368
Believe it or not, neither can I.

355
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.769
So, if I remember correctly,

356
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.241
the Vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers.

357
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.004
That is correct, Doctor.

358
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.409
That explains a thing or two.

359
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.611
You know, you're lucky.
An inch to the left...

360
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.363
And you'd be dead already.

361
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.569
I just don't get it, Spock.

362
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.927
I mean, what did they attack us for?

363
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.565
I mean, they do all this for some
doodad that the tiny critters didn't want?

364
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.324
It is unwise to trivialize

365
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.880
that which one simply
does not understand, Doctor.

366
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.089
We can safely assume
it is more important than a doodad.

367
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.724
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.

368
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.521
Okay.

369
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.560
All right, Spock, I just got one question.

370
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.768
- What's your favorite color?
- I fail to see the relevance.

371
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.091
Yeah. They say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.

372
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.527
If I may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar,

373
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.922
I can confirm your theory to be horseshit.

374
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.284
We got to get out of here.

375
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.601
Come on.

376
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.248
You're kidding me, aren't you?

377
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.480
Hello there.

378
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.049
My name is Montgomery Scott.
And who might you be?

379
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.921
Watch it, sonny.

380
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.651
I'm pretty handy
when I want to be, all right?

381
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.725
Don't come back!

382
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.888
We certainly showed them, lassie?

383
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.565
That's Starfleet property, okay.
You cannae just take it.

384
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.291
But I'm feeling generous today,
so have at it.

385
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.044
Where you get that?

386
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.929
- Is that English?
- I learn it from my house.

387
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.287
- Where you get that?
- It's my Starfleet insignia.

388
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.282
What does it mean?

389
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.728
Means that I'm an officer of Starfleet.
Engineering division.

390
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.640
- Engineering?
- That's right. I fix things.

391
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.563
I know what is engineering.

392
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.522
You're not with those bastards
that killed my ship, are you?

393
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.930
I'll take that as a no.

394
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.525
He is Krall. Him and his

395
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.361
bees.

396
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.088
They search the stars for a death machine.

397
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.482
They're the reason why you here.
Why we are all here.

398
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.569
Even those three scunners?

399
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.684
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.

400
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.928
Come with me. Now!

401
00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.689
Wait, no... Hang on a minute, lassie.
I'm having a difficult day here.

402
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.728
I've got to find my crewmates.

403
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.962
I will help you find your mates.

404
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.769
And then you will help me.

405
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.641
With what?

406
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.600
You want me to fix something?

407
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.286
Yes. You help me, and I help you.

408
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.130
All right, well, things being as they are,

409
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.885
I doubt I'll get a better offer today,
so, lead the way.

410
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.081
Good.

411
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.764
I am Jaylah.

412
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.411
- And you are Montgomery Scott.
- Aye, Scotty.

413
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.649
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

414
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.200
All right, hold up.

415
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.729
The Enterprise.

416
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.725
She may not even have power
to the Bridge, Captain.

417
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.366
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

418
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.851
I'd bet on it.

419
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.643
McCoy to Enterprise. Come in.

420
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.883
McCoy to Enterprise.

421
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.886
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.

422
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.849
That was just a temporary fix back there.

423
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.490
I understand, Doctor.

424
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.206
Fascinating.

425
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.601
Ominous. Dark. Dangerous.

426
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.251
We're going in.

427
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.011
Intriguing. These symbols
are the same as those

428
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.328
depicted on the artifact
taken in the attack.

429
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.323
You think it came from here?

430
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.884
It would seem so.

431
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.531
Damn it, Spock.

432
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.645
Easy. Easy.

433
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.205
Hurry.

434
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.811
- Are we there yet?
- Stop asking that.

435
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.561
- Sorry.
- This is the way. Come.

436
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.888
And watch your steps.
You do not want to set off my traps.

437
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.125
That's clever.

438
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.450
What is this place?

439
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.964
- This is my house.
- Your house?

440
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.646
Hold on a minute. Is this a ship?

441
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.442
I help you find your friends
and you help me fix it.

442
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.722
So I can leave this planet forever.

443
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.964
Wait a minute. Is this your ship?

444
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.004
No, Montgomery Scotty.

445
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.971
It's yours.

446
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.730
Oh, my good Lord.

447
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.320
Captain, it looks like there is power.

448
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.890
All right, let's get to the Bridge
and find the crew.

449
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.490
The console is intact, Captain.

450
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.370
I will try to reroute power to it.

451
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.326
Work fast.

452
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.086
Once we get this place lit up,
we're gonna draw a lot of attention.

453
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.245
What do you think, can you find them?

454
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.481
Aye, Captain.

455
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.121
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crew's signals.

456
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.090
You're with me. I left something behind.

457
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.130
That is one heck of a cold.

458
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.770
Nice job, Keenser.

459
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.205
All right, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation. Come on.

460
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.485
Let's go. Come on.

461
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.960
Come on.

462
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.402
This is the Magellan Probe.

463
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.282
The Federation was using these
to find a way through the nebula.

464
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.328
What's he using it for?

465
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.285
What do you see?

466
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.161
He's been piggybacking
the subspace links between the probes.

467
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.686
Can we use it to send a distress signal?

468
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.361
I can try.

469
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.006
It's sent.

470
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.242
He's accessed the Yorktown database.

471
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.321
What?

472
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.202
He's got Starfleet data files, ship logs,

473
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.409
including the Enterprise.

474
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.087
He's been watching us this whole time.

475
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.726
Captain,

476
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.051
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time?

477
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.927
I couldn't afford to get caught with it,
so I hid it in here.

478
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.322
Tell Krall I have the Abronath.

479
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.521
Do you believe every sad story you hear?

480
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.931
Not every.

481
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.729
Put the phaser down.

482
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.241
Please.

483
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.371
You get it, Chekov?

484
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.364
Aye, Captain, I have traced
the location of her call.

485
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.881
What does Krall want with this thing?

486
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.284
To save you

487
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.285
from yourselves.

488
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.641
Captain!

489
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.691
- You all right?
- Aye, Captain,

490
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.564
but we are trapped!

491
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.726
Can you get this thing started?

492
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.451
Are you intimating that we should
engage the thrusters?

493
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.364
- I am open to other suggestions.
- Okay.

494
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.289
- There is a problem.
- What?

495
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.250
The fuel is primed,
but I cannot get it to combust.

496
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.167
Oy, Captain, we are basically
standing on a very large bomb.

497
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.571
If you miss the combustion compressor...

498
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.641
I'm not gonna miss, come on.

499
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.802
Do you even know what
the combustion compressor looks like?

500
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.365
It's square, right?

501
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.330
No, sir, it's round.

502
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.930
That's what I said.

503
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.847
Run!

504
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.246
Go!

505
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.845
Chekov!

506
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.531
Chekov! Move!

507
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.368
You think you know

508
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.923
what sacrifice really means?

509
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.290
Federation has taught you
that conflict should not exist.

510
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.445
But without struggle,

511
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.446
you would never know who you truly are.

512
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.243
You have no idea who we are.

513
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.124
But you'll soon find out.

514
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.124
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent?

515
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.243
The coordinates were altered.

516
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.529
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula

517
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.126
and your base left vulnerable.

518
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.042
You're going to attack Yorktown.

519
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.327
Millions of souls from every
Federation world holding hands.

520
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.644
It's a perfect target.

521
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.324
You're wrong. There is strength in unity.

522
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.847
The strength of others, Lieutenant,

523
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.560
is what has kept me alive.

524
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.081
No!

525
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.441
Spock.

526
00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.363
Spock, wake up, damn it!

527
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.568
I am entirely conscious, Doctor.

528
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.363
I'm simply contemplating
the nature of mortality.

529
00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.804
Feeling philosophical?

530
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.200
Massive blood loss will do that to you.

531
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.327
You asked me why
Lieutenant Uhura and I parted ways.

532
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.691
I became concerned,
in the light of Vulcan's demise,

533
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.240
that I owed a debt of duty to my species.

534
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.083
You thought you should be off
making little Vulcans?

535
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.086
Yeah, I can see how that would upset her.

536
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.083
I intended to discuss it with her further,

537
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.289
but I received some news
which affected me unexpectedly.

538
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.251
What news?

539
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.446
Ambassador Spock has died.

540
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.682
Spock, I'm so sorry.

541
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.764
I can't imagine what that must feel like.

542
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.284
When you've lived as many lives as he,

543
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.047
fear of death is illogical.

544
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.124
Fear of death

545
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.801
is what keeps us alive.

546
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.963
I want to live as he did.

547
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.323
That is why I decided

548
00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.249
to redirect my efforts
and continue his work

549
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.520
on New Vulcan.

550
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.082
You're leaving Starfleet?

551
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.647
What did Jim have to say about that?

552
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.647
I could not find the time to tell him.

553
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.845
Well, I can tell you
he's not gonna like that.

554
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.606
Hell, I don't know
what he'd do without you.

555
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.246
I mean, me on the other hand,
I'd throw a party, but...

556
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.848
My God, you're getting delirious.

557
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.885
How far are we
from the coordinates of that call?

558
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.365
Still a ways, sir.

559
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.246
- Captain?
- Yeah.

560
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.207
When did you begin to suspect her?

561
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.690
Not soon enough.

562
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.125
How did you know?

563
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.241
Well...

564
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.930
I guess you could say
I've got a good nose for danger.

565
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.001
Run!

566
00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.445
Is that music?

567
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.682
Where on earth is that coming from?

568
00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.281
There.

569
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.244
I plugged the little box in the power cell
and the little mouths make it sing.

570
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.930
That's very clever.

571
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.682
Music's a bit old-fashioned for my taste,
not to mention very loud and distracting,

572
00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.410
but, aye, well played.

573
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.283
I like the beats and shouting.

574
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.521
You do?

575
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.485
- Switch it off.
- You're okay.

576
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.931
Switch it off!

577
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.242
Someone set off one of my traps.

578
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.001
Captain?

579
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.649
- You know these men?
- Aye, lassie.

580
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.047
- That wee man there is Pavel Chekov.
- Hello.

581
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.487
And that handsome bastard
is James T. Kirk.

582
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.840
They're my mates.

583
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.649
It's good to see you, sir.

584
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.764
What is she doing, Scotty?

585
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.649
Don't hurt them. No, don't!

586
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.767
Hit her!

587
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.964
- You're free, James T.
- There we go.

588
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.801
Mr. Scott.

589
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.364
Who's your new friend here?

590
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.720
She sure knows
how to throw out a welcome mat.

591
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.849
- This is Jaylah.
- I do not know what is a welcome mat.

592
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.008
- You find anybody else?
- No, sir.

593
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.971
I'm sorry, you're the only ones.

594
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.281
What the hell happened up there, Jim?
Why were we attacked?

595
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.091
They were after the artifact
we brought back from Teenax.

596
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.968
- Did they get it?
- No.

597
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.087
- Have you got it?
- No.

598
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.401
I had to get it off the Enterprise,
put it on a shuttle.

599
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.403
- You hid it in a shuttle.
- Yes.

600
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.121
And no.

601
01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.442
This is the U.S.S. Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it?

602
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.761
First Earth ship capable of warp 4.

603
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.889
Went missing in the Gagarin
Radiation Belt in the early 2160s.

604
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.411
I remember that from the Academy.

605
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.209
Captain Balthazar Edison.

606
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.050
One of the first heroes of Starfleet.

607
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.929
How the hell did his ship end up here?

608
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.331
There's a lot of theories, sir.

609
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.688
Surrendered to the Romulans.
Captured by a giant green space hand.

610
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.001
This far out, it's got to be
a wormhole displacement.

611
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.241
Can she fly?

612
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.290
She's missing a few driver coils
and the EPS conduits are fried,

613
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.362
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job

614
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.403
of getting the ship's systems back online.

615
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.926
- Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.
- Pardon me.

616
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.162
Mr. Chekov,
can you plug in the coordinates.

617
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.806
See if you can track the crew's location
from the ship's sensors.

618
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.086
Aye, Captain.

619
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.009
- He likes that seat.
- Mr. Scott.

620
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.770
- Tour.
- Yes, the mess hall.

621
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.888
- Jaylah, if you will.
- Yes.

622
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.328
No clue what happened to the crew?

623
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.491
No, sir. They'd be dead
a hundred years by now.

624
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.561
Is that a...

625
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.049
That's a PX70!

626
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.086
My dad used to have one when he was a kid.

627
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.441
My mom said he'd put her
on the back of it, drive her nuts.

628
01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.641
Sir.

629
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.406
So you're telling me
this thing's been here this whole time

630
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.403
and no one's ever noticed it?

631
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.606
She's rigged up image refractors.

632
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.121
Here.

633
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.370
So, like some sort of
holographic camouflage.

634
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.687
Aye, sir.

635
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.041
Captain!

636
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.329
I have intercepted a weak
communications transmission, sir.

637
01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.209
It's a Starfleet frequency.

638
01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.883
Can you lock on to the signal?

639
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.008
Yes, but how do we get to them?

640
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.490
I have an idea, sir.

641
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.723
But I'm gonna need your permission.

642
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.961
Why would you need my permission?

643
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.408
Because if I mess it up,
I don't want it to be just my fault.

644
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.762
McCoy and Spock to Enterprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.

645
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.207
Anyone.

646
01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.371
Come on, Spock.

647
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.689
Come on, you can make it.

648
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.121
Leaving me behind
will significantly increase

649
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.884
your chances of survival, Doctor.

650
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.526
Well, that's damn chivalrous of you,
but completely out of the question.

651
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.763
It is imperative that
you locate any surviving crew.

652
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.008
And here I was thinking you cared.

653
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.564
Of course I care, Leonard.

654
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.603
I always assumed
my respect for you was clear.

655
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.566
The dialogue we have had
across the years has always...

656
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.005
It's okay, Spock.

657
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.564
You don't have to say it.

658
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.811
Well, at least I won't die alone.

659
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.570
Well, that's just typical.

660
01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.608
Come on, you bastards!

661
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.971
Good to see you in one piece, Doctor.

662
01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.201
Am I?

663
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.967
I feel like my innards
have been to a barn dance!

664
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.202
Aye, well, these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo,

665
01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.044
but a few modifications
seem to do the trick.

666
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.122
I thought it best to
beam you one at a time, though.

667
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.362
You know, in case you got spliced.

668
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.848
I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

669
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.285
Good to have you back. You all right?

670
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.691
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

671
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.603
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

672
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.841
In a pig's eye, you are!

673
01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.287
Captain, we discovered
that the stolen artifact

674
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.488
appears to have come from this planet.

675
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.891
Damn it, Spock.

676
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.124
Are there any medical supplies
on this thing?

677
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.247
This way.

678
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.327
All right. Lie down. Come on.

679
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.366
There you go.

680
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.245
How are we gonna get out
of this one, Spock?

681
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.642
We've got no ship, no crew.
Not the best odds.

682
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.245
We will do what we have always done, Jim.

683
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.727
We will find hope in the impossible.

684
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.165
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

685
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.441
No, Captain.

686
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.728
You must focus your efforts
on helping the crew.

687
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.280
Well, that's why I need you around, Spock.

688
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.407
These things are from the dark ages.

689
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.161
Bones.

690
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.687
I'm pretty sure this is a protoplaser.

691
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.843
Should stop the internal hemorrhaging.

692
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.445
At least that's my hope.

693
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.490
"The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope."

694
01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.605
Death's door and he's quoting Shakespeare.

695
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.482
Captain's Log, Stardate 2262.18.

696
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.568
The mission, routine investigation...

697
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.528
If the universe is truly endless...

698
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.524
What seemed so clear to me
two years ago now seems,

699
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.443
well, far away.

700
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.044
You will tell me where it is!

701
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.121
Now!

702
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.681
Stop! Stop!

703
01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.324
Let him go and I will give you
what you want!

704
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.811
No! Syl, don't!

705
01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.081
Lieutenant, unity is not your strength.

706
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.405
It is your weakness.

707
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.885
We should wait until
we're absolutely sure.

708
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.440
No, we have to get the crew back now.

709
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.964
Chekov has the coordinates that can
lead us to Krall's base, so we go!

710
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.486
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base

711
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.442
when she called him?

712
01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.483
Even if he was, we don't know
that the crew is even with him.

713
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.561
Or if they're even still alive.

714
01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.722
Mr. Chekov, can you reconfigure
the search parameters

715
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.201
in order to compensate for this formula?

716
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.884
Aye, Commander, but what is this formula?

717
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.805
It is Vokaya, Mr. Chekov.

718
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.884
A mineral unique to Vulcan
which emits low-level radiation.

719
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.804
I will have to filter out
all other energy emissions.

720
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.406
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here?

721
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.766
Where are you going with this?

722
01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.649
Lieutenant Uhura wears a Vokaya amulet

723
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.088
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.

724
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.288
You gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelry?

725
01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.646
The emission is harmless, Doctor.

726
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.570
But its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify.

727
01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.331
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device.

728
01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.329
That was not my intention.

729
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.482
I'm glad he doesn't respect me.

730
01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.682
I am detecting
a very trace amount of Vokaya.

731
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.761
Does the location match the coordinates
you acquired from Kalara, Mr. Chekov?

732
01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.205
It is a match, sir.

733
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.011
Its presence suggests that Lieutenant
Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew

734
01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.401
are being held
at Krall's base of operation.

735
01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.084
Can you beam them out?

736
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.846
No, sir. There is some
geological interference

737
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.241
that is blocking the transporter signal.

738
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.285
Well, I guess we're gonna have to go in
and break them out the old-fashioned way.

739
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.886
You cannot go to this place.

740
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.042
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

741
01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.768
You've been there? You've seen it?

742
01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.890
Well, why didn't you
say something, lassie?

743
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.770
Because I know you will
ask me to take you there.

744
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.881
If your friends are there,
then they will die, just like my family.

745
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.560
And I will not go back
to that death place!

746
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.484
Aye, but if you've escaped, then you can
show us the way in and the way out.

747
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.484
No! This is not the deal we made,
Montgomery Scotty.

748
01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.411
If you choose to do this,
you are on your own.

749
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.001
Wait.

750
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.161
Let her go.

751
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.402
She's lost people, too, Captain.

752
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.568
Look, that's our friends out there,
lassie. Right?

753
01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.768
We cannae just leave them behind.

754
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.844
Now, we could really use your help.

755
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.447
We just need you to be brave, is all.

756
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.601
When we were in that place,

757
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.921
Krall would come and take someone.

758
01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.250
There were screams.

759
01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.410
I can still hear them.

760
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.643
And we would not see that person again.

761
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.041
We did not know who would be next.

762
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.802
My father planned an escape.

763
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.962
But we were seen
by the one they call Manas.

764
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.122
My father fought him so I could get out.

765
01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.210
He was brave and Manas killed him.

766
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.768
What you want is impossible.

767
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.484
Look, maybe it's not.

768
01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.325
Right. My wee granny used to say,
"Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."

769
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.011
You're part of
something bigger now, lassie.

770
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.850
Right? Dinnae give up on that.

771
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.922
'Cause we'll sure as hell
never give up on you.

772
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.685
That is what being part of a crew
is all about.

773
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.321
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

774
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.691
All I know is we stand
a better chance with you.

775
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.804
The digging machines uncovered
a tunnel that goes into the crater.

776
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.086
That's how I got out.

777
01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.810
So that'll be our way in.

778
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.928
An away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel,

779
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.126
follow it to Krall's base,

780
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.641
get inside the building
and break out the crew.

781
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.610
Captain, we cannot lock onto anyone
inside the crater

782
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.806
in order to beam them out.

783
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.042
I could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers.

784
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.281
That'd get the signal out of the crater.

785
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.327
- All right.
- How many people can

786
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.686
the Franklin transport at a time?

787
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.001
With a wee bit of modification, 20 max,

788
01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.923
but I'm not sure
how long it would hold out.

789
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.401
Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,
you're with me on the away team.

790
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.323
Mr. Scott, modify that transporter

791
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.482
and then do everything you can
to get this ship operational.

792
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.324
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

793
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.165
makes him more valuable
aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

794
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.527
It is thereby logical
that I would replace him.

795
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.729
Why is that logical, Spock?
You just got back on your feet.

796
01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.326
Lieutenant Uhura is in that facility, Jim.

797
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.050
I'll keep an eye on him.

798
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.726
Understood.

799
01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.805
But his soldiers are everywhere.

800
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.450
We won't pass unseen.

801
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.682
What we require is a diversion.

802
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.404
I think I have an idea.

803
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.204
This is Abronath.

804
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.931
It was used by the Ancient Ones
as a weapon.

805
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.449
But when they could not
control its deadly power,

806
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.242
they split it into two
and ejected the halves into space,

807
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.961
hoping it would be lost forever.

808
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.367
But I am grateful.

809
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.129
I have spent lifetimes searching for it,

810
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.123
only to have you

811
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.602
find it for me.

812
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.042
The poetry of fate.

813
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.450
The world that I was born into

814
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.088
is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

815
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.811
We knew pain. We knew terror.

816
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.009
Struggle made us strong.

817
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.084
Not peace. Not unity.

818
01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.051
These are myths
the Federation would have you believe.

819
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.364
Those are strong words.

820
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.041
You might even believe them,

821
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.361
but there's something else
going on with you.

822
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.965
Something underneath.

823
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.201
Uhura!

824
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.006
Wait.

825
01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.643
What are you doing with her?

826
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.280
You already got what you wanted!
Let her go!

827
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.566
Syl!

828
01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.126
No, please!

829
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.490
Let her go!

830
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.727
Manas, it's time.

831
01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.289
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries.

832
01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.444
But no longer.

833
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.161
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

834
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.843
This is where the frontier pushes back.

835
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.886
This way.

836
01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.406
Where is she?

837
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.924
I've got to admit,
that's a hell of a distraction.

838
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.243
Your friends are over there.

839
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.246
Come on.

840
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.286
Go!

841
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.801
Commander. Uhura, they took her.

842
01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.166
Get the remainder of the crew to safety.

843
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.249
Come on, let's go! Move!

844
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.727
- Stay in the circle.
- Come on! Hurry!

845
01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.602
I've got them, Mr. Scott!

846
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.324
Okay, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal.

847
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.925
We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.

848
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.809
- Aye.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

849
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.405
Energize!

850
01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.006
Spock.

851
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.963
What are you doing here?

852
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.682
Clearly, I am here to rescue you.

853
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.881
Let's go.

854
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.444
Good to see you, wee man.

855
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.969
Ten seconds until
the transporter's recharged, Doctor.

856
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.008
- Wait for my signal.
- Doctor!

857
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.686
Damn it, man,
we're not leaving without them!

858
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.729
Come on. Let's go. Move!

859
01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.251
Let's go! Come on!

860
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.440
We're ready for you next, Captain.
Just turn on your beacon.

861
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.329
Scotty, do you have everybody?

862
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.561
Aye, sir. Everyone except you and Jaylah.

863
01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.768
Hit the beacon and we'll grab you.

864
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.730
Captain, your beacon!

865
01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.610
- There it is!
- Energize.

866
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.530
Jaylah, now!

867
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.161
Okay...

868
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.403
Let's never do that again.

869
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.250
I agree, James T.

870
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.680
You all right?

871
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.962
Captain! This thing he has...

872
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.647
Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

873
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.010
You take my house

874
01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.964
and you make it fly.

875
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:42.728
Scotty, can you get this thing started?

876
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.802
Started, yes.
Flying, sir, that's a different thing.

877
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.490
These old vessels,
they were built in space.

878
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.961
They were never supposed to
take off from atmosphere.

879
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.166
Make it happen.

880
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.083
They're called starships
for a reason, Captain.

881
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.730
You're telling me this now?

882
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.168
Because I didn't want to disappoint you,
you know, in case you didn't make it back.

883
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.481
- How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.
- Captain.

884
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.686
He's launching.

885
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.445
The attack on Yorktown
may be just the beginning.

886
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.569
Armed with this bio-weapon,
he could rid it of all life

887
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.251
and use the base's advanced technology

888
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.130
to attack an untold number
of Federation planets.

889
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.363
Then we're just gonna have to
get this thing flying.

890
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.522
We cannae just jumpstart it, sir!

891
01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.926
Okay! All systems online.

892
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.562
Dilithium chambers at 70% and climbing.

893
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.411
Primary support engines standing by.

894
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.045
Mr. Sulu.

895
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.806
You can, you know, fly this thing, right?

896
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.770
You kidding me, sir?

897
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.280
Fantastic.

898
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.724
Scotty, how we looking?

899
01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.366
Ready as she'll ever be, sir.

900
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.249
That's what I like to hear. All right.

901
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.810
Bones, where are we with the crew?

902
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.487
I could use a functioning med-bay,
but otherwise we're secure down here.

903
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.007
Mr. Sulu, we have to achieve
terminal velocity

904
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.526
in order for the stabilizers to provide lift.

905
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.490
Are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that?

906
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.251
We'll find out.

907
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.769
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

908
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.651
Aye-aye, Captain.

909
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.809
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers full on my mark.

910
01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.609
- One quarter impulse.
- Aye.

911
01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.282
One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.

912
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.647
Aye.

913
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.083
We should belt up. Go on. Go!

914
01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.851
Easy, Mr. Sulu.
Let's not break her in half.

915
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.690
Any time, Mr. Sulu.

916
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.611
Now, Mr. Chekov!

917
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.931
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

918
01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.051
No reply to all-frequency I.D. request.

919
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.167
Visual.

920
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.370
Red alert! Red alert!

921
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.884
Look how far they've come.

922
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.048
Please proceed to designated
safety zones immediately

923
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.522
Please proceed to designated
safety zones immediately

924
01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.611
I'm picking up distress signals

925
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.126
from every frequency coming from Yorktown.

926
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.402
Krall's already started his attack.

927
01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.801
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons
do we have?

928
01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.770
We have pulsed phase cannons
and spatial torpedoes.

929
01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.561
Great. Lock and load.

930
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.246
It does not matter.
You cannot defeat the bees.

931
01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.561
Maybe, maybe we lure them away.

932
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.007
How do we get Yorktown time
to get people to safety?

933
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.128
No, we are a horse and buggy
compared to those things.

934
01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.168
We're barely holding together
as it is, Captain.

935
01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.086
Captain, the flight patterns of bees
are determined by individual decisions.

936
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.845
Krall's swarm formations
are too complex not to rely

937
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.241
on some form of
unified cyberpathic coordination.

938
01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.971
- I surmise that if we...
- Spock! Skip to the end.

939
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.929
What he's saying is that
if we disorient the swarm

940
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.684
we can kick its ass!

941
01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.525
Precisely.

942
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.603
Scotty, can you beam me
onto one of those swarm ships?

943
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.966
Have you gone completely mad?

944
01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.280
- Yes or no?
- No!

945
01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.407
Yes!

946
01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.681
Maybe.

947
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.561
Captain, my familiarity
of the interior of those ships,

948
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.246
however brief, makes me more qualified
for this away mission.

949
01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.049
Spock, you're still hurt.

950
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.045
She's right, Spock.

951
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.801
I acknowledge and respect your concerns.

952
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.171
Perhaps you would feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone

953
01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.005
with familiarity of both
the ship and my injury.

954
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.124
He's gonna love this.

955
01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.324
You want me to do what?

956
01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.847
- Come along, Doctor.
- Wait a minute.

957
01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.890
Why, you green-blooded ingrate.
This was your idea!

958
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.721
It's a good idea, Bones.

959
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.484
You know, next time
you have a piece of pipe

960
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.040
stuck in your transverse, call a plumber.

961
01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.805
Just make sure you find a way
to break those things.

962
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.848
If it gets hairy,
I'll beam you straight back.

963
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.967
Energize.

964
01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.844
You're gonna do great!

965
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.402
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a...

966
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.731
You do realize the last time
I flew one of these things we crashed.

967
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.088
So don't blame me if we...

968
01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.120
Hit something.

969
01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.845
Spock to Franklin.

970
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.001
Spock, we read you.

971
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.204
Captain, from what I can ascertain,
the ships do indeed share a cyberpathic link

972
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.560
which coordinates their actions.

973
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.369
Patching it through now.

974
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.763
That's what that signal was.

975
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.241
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

976
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.527
Well, how do we get them to stop talking?

977
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.364
What about electromagnetic focusing?

978
01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.090
We could use the transporters,
disrupt their network.

979
01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.208
The focus might be too specific.

980
01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.045
If we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm,

981
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.202
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate.

982
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.851
It would have to be
at a frequency they will not anticipate.

983
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.526
We could cause a chain reaction
that would wipe out the whole swarm.

984
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.931
Sir, a closed network like that

985
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.606
might be susceptible
to very high frequency.

986
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.291
VHF.

987
01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.087
Radio. We can broadcast something
from the ship to drown out their link.

988
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.764
Something loud and distracting.

989
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.444
Loud and distracting?

990
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.369
I've got just the thing!

991
01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.084
Do not break my music.

992
01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.567
Break it? You're getting an upgrade.

993
01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.608
Swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through!

994
01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.048
I've just got to reconfigure the VHF
output into a multiphasic sweep.

995
01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.326
Let me do it.

996
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.000
Let her do it.

997
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.446
You do it.

998
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.403
There, see? Simple.

999
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.046
All right. Captain,
we're ready to broadcast.

1000
01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.851
But the signal won't travel far.
We have to get closer.

1001
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.763
- How close?
- Very.

1002
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.642
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.
Put us right in the middle of that thing.

1003
01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.881
Yes, sir.

1004
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.049
My old friend.

1005
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.447
The swarm ships are doubling back!
They are forming an attack wave, sir.

1006
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.971
I think we got their attention.

1007
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.042
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1008
01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.884
Spock, stand by to drop out of formation.

1009
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.122
- Scotty, you all cued up back there?
- Aye, sir!

1010
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.680
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 megahertz.

1011
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.807
Made your choice, lassie?

1012
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.803
I have the beat and shouting.

1013
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.604
Let's make some noise.

1014
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.610
That's a good choice.

1015
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.243
Faster, Doctor. We risk being
consumed by their trajectorial decay.

1016
01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.845
Damn backseat driver.

1017
01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.282
- Evade, Doctor!
- I see it, I see it!

1018
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.809
Is that classical music?

1019
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.128
Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be.

1020
01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.326
Lieutenant Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.

1021
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.922
Sir, we now have the disruption frequency.

1022
01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.166
Broadcast.

1023
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.851
- You two all right, Spock?
- We are fine, Captain,

1024
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.207
but there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.

1025
01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.964
That's got to be Krall.
Keep on him, Spock.

1026
01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.169
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.

1027
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.970
My house is breaking!

1028
01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.841
We've lost the polarization
of the hull plating!

1029
01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.082
I can reroute the power
from the dilithium chambers.

1030
01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.687
I need you.
And I need you, Jaylah. Let's go!

1031
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.005
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1032
01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.243
You're more than welcome
to switch places with me, Spock.

1033
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.809
Captain, intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility.

1034
01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.328
Get me a schematic of Yorktown!

1035
01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.362
There! Yorktown headquarters!

1036
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.205
Mr. Chekov,
can you do a bioscan of Central Plaza?

1037
01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:57.045
Aye. They are clearing civilians.

1038
01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.043
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1039
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.202
You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.

1040
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.611
- Why?
- Just do it!

1041
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.045
Sulu, get us up there.

1042
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.645
Hold onto something!

1043
01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.362
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Jim.

1044
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.251
Now I've just got to
figure out how to land.

1045
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.451
Captain, I have three hull breaches
from the impact.

1046
01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.046
Deck 3, the cargo bay,
and the engine room.

1047
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.605
All right, Sulu, Chekov,
check the cargo bay and Deck 3.

1048
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.762
We need confirmation that
the weapon has been neutralized

1049
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.205
and Krall is dead!

1050
01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.801
Captain!

1051
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.921
It's Krall.

1052
01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.525
We've seen him do this.

1053
01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.047
It's some kind of energy transference.
It physically changes him.

1054
01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:15.886
He must still be onboard.
We would have seen him leave.

1055
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.529
Sulu, contact Yorktown security
and lock down the ship.

1056
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.841
Let's go.

1057
01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.330
Push the frontier.

1058
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.725
It's about damn time.

1059
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.041
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1060
01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.122
All right, baby, let's go.

1061
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.680
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1062
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.806
Captain!

1063
01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.440
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1064
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.246
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1065
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.926
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1066
01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.640
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1067
01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.011
...frontier.

1068
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.005
...frontier.

1069
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.126
It's him.

1070
01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:28.483
Scotty, I need you to link
into the Franklin database.

1071
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.881
Find out what you can
about Balthazar Edison.

1072
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.769
- The captain of the Franklin?
- Yeah.

1073
01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.888
- Sir, he'll be long dead.
- No. He's not.

1074
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.247
I don't know how, but Edison is Krall.

1075
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.881
What'd you find?

1076
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.282
His record goes back
way before the Federation even existed.

1077
01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.443
He was a major in
the United Earth Military Assault

1078
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.682
Command Operation.
A lot of off-world combat.

1079
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.761
He was a soldier.

1080
01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.966
Aye, sir. And a pretty good one.

1081
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.850
His military service came to an end
when MACO was disbanded.

1082
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.241
- Why, what happened?
- The Federation, sir. Starfleet.

1083
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.446
We're not a military agency.

1084
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.409
They made him a captain
and gave him the Franklin.

1085
01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.721
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Aye, sir.

1086
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.121
- Captain's Log...
- Last entry.

1087
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.206
Captain's Log...
I don't remember the stardate.

1088
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.042
All distress calls unanswered.

1089
01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.766
Of the crew,

1090
01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.051
only three remain.

1091
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.483
I won't allow it!

1092
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.042
The indigenous race
abandoned this planet long ago.

1093
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.564
They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment

1094
01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.644
and a drone workforce.

1095
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.244
They have some sort of technology

1096
01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.324
that prolongs life.

1097
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.124
I will do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.

1098
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.001
The Federation do not care about us.

1099
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.451
You'll probably never see me again.

1100
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.925
But if you do,

1101
01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.931
be ready,

1102
01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.608
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1103
01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.365
'Cause he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.

1104
01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.442
He needs a distribution system.

1105
01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.771
They have to circulate air here, right?

1106
01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.650
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric
regulator at the core.

1107
01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.643
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown.
Make sure they shut it down

1108
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.370
- until we find Krall.
- Yes.

1109
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.885
How would he access the core?

1110
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.849
Well, there's a maintenance tower

1111
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.400
at the station's gravitational nexus.
That's the only way.

1112
01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:31.926
Scotty, you get over there.
Make sure it gets shut down!

1113
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.240
Lassie, you're with me.

1114
01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.767
Look, this thing is impossible
to shut down.

1115
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.126
Aye, well,

1116
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.530
we'll see about that.

1117
01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.048
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

1118
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.161
We're working on it, sir,

1119
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.368
but as you can imagine
there's a lot of safety protocols

1120
01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.885
surrounding the thing that, you know,

1121
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.042
- keeps everybody alive.
- Figure something out.

1122
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.121
Be careful, Captain.

1123
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.807
Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy
the closer you get to the center.

1124
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.451
Maybe we should scan
the operational schematics,

1125
01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.249
- see if there's a back door.
- Right.

1126
01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.402
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1127
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.161
Stop!

1128
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.963
What happened to you out there, Edison?

1129
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.240
Edison.

1130
01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.881
I have to say, Kirk,

1131
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.851
I've missed being me.

1132
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.204
We lost ourselves but gained a purpose!

1133
01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.520
A means to bring the galaxy

1134
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.321
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong.

1135
01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.089
I think you underestimate humanity.

1136
01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.083
I fought for humanity!

1137
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.884
Lost millions
to the Xindi and Romulan Wars.

1138
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.520
And for what?

1139
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.202
For the Federation
to sit me in a captain's chair

1140
01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.405
and break bread with the enemy.

1141
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.888
We change. We have to.

1142
01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.488
Or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

1143
01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.806
You lost!

1144
01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.006
There's no way you can make it back there.

1145
01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.125
Give up.

1146
01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.764
What, like you did?

1147
01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.082
I read your ship's log,

1148
01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.442
Captain James T. Kirk.

1149
01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.604
At least I know what I am.

1150
01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.450
I am a soldier.

1151
01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.802
You won the war, Edison.

1152
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.723
You gave us peace.

1153
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.280
Peace

1154
01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.408
is not what I was born into.

1155
01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.121
Scotty.

1156
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.407
Captain, he's using
the gravitational slipstream

1157
01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.482
to carry him back to the center.

1158
01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.601
Nah.

1159
01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.690
No! No!

1160
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.690
- What's that?
- The weapon's in the chamber.

1161
01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.444
Captain, we have to stop the processor now

1162
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.251
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead!

1163
01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.640
You can't stop it.

1164
01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.691
You will die.

1165
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.848
Better to die saving lives

1166
01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.528
than to live with taking them.

1167
01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.562
That's what I was born into.

1168
01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.201
Scotty!

1169
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.925
Captain, I think we can redirect it.

1170
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.764
There's a sealed construction hatch

1171
01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.524
that will let you vent the weapon
into space.

1172
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.485
We can override the locks from up here,
but you will have to activate the hatch.

1173
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.800
So I just hit a button.

1174
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.407
It's not a button, sir.
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

1175
01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.162
- Got it!
- And there's four of them.

1176
01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.001
Once you've primed the hatch,

1177
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.889
you'll have to exit
the chamber immediately.

1178
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.849
If the hatch is open
when the processor cycles

1179
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.002
and you're in it,
you're gonna get sucked into space.

1180
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.889
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

1181
01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.803
You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.

1182
01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.008
With the weapon, and we all die.

1183
01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.046
Damn it, Jim,
you won't make it out in time!

1184
01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:55.887
The vent!

1185
01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.169
Get out of there, James T.!

1186
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.566
Scotty, the last hatch won't open!

1187
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.681
Scotty!

1188
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.888
Work fast, Captain, time's running out!

1189
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.610
He's not gonna make it.

1190
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.801
No! No!

1191
01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.081
Manual override engaged.

1192
01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.567
What would I do without you, Spock?

1193
01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.088
For decades the Federation taught
that he was a hero.

1194
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.687
I guess time will judge us all.

1195
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.090
He just got lost.

1196
01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:14.482
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1197
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.531
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1198
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.004
It wasn't just me. It never is.

1199
01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.405
Needless to say,
the position of Vice Admiral is yours.

1200
01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.889
No one deserves it more.

1201
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.602
Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?

1202
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.082
No. They don't.

1203
01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.522
Well, no offense, ma'am,

1204
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.763
but where's the fun in that?

1205
01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.251
You didn't even try
to get our time out here reduced?

1206
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.207
Why would I get it reduced?

1207
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.931
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

1208
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.525
Can you imagine what we'll find!

1209
01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.001
Alien despots hell-bent on killing us?

1210
01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.481
Deadly space-borne viruses and bacteria?

1211
01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.571
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant!

1212
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.484
It's gonna be so much fun.

1213
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.240
By the way, where are we going?

1214
01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.924
I thought we were gonna get a drink.

1215
01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.566
I know you told me
to keep it under wraps, but...

1216
01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.051
Happy Birthday!

1217
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:19.490
Mr. Sensitive?

1218
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.567
- There you go, laddie.
- Thanks, Scotty.

1219
01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.808
Everybody, raise a glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1220
01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.882
- Captain Kirk!
- Thanks, everybody.

1221
01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.486
- To the Enterprise.
- To the Enterprise.

1222
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.971
And

1223
01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.290
to absent friends.

1224
01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.889
- Here's to that.
- Cheers.

1225
01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.487
All right, let's get this party started.

1226
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.641
Whose round is it?

1227
01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.406
Can I get three Romulan ales for me?

1228
01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.725
I thought you had to
finish your mission report.

1229
01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.480
I do.

1230
01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:57.246
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socially.

1231
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.365
You old romantic.

1232
01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.691
Do you know that
scotch was actually invented

1233
01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.762
by a little old lady in Russia?

1234
01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.607
- Not many people know.
- Excuse me.

1235
01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.408
Did you drink all those yourself?
I'm impressed.

1236
01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.967
Someone said it will take my edge off.

1237
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.284
My edge is still not off.

1238
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.361
All right, well, maybe this will help.

1239
01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.762
Captain pulled a few strings.

1240
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.443
That is acceptance
into Starfleet Academy, if you want it.

1241
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.844
They have a lot of rules.
Don't listen to them all.

1242
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.122
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1243
01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.451
Afraid so.

1244
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.120
Hey, Keenser.

1245
01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:49.766
Kevin. Still not wearing pants, I see.

1246
01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.442
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1247
01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.567
Is that what you wanted
to mention that time in the turbolift?

1248
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.686
More or less.

1249
01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.163
I trust your meeting with
Commodore Paris went well.

1250
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.885
More or less.

1251
01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.001
You really want to head back out there?

1252
01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.844
Space, the final frontier.

1253
01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.202
These are the voyages of the Starship...

1254
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.443
...Enterprise. Its continuing mission...

1255
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.887
To explore strange new worlds.

1256
01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.690
To seek out new life.

1257
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.723
And new civilizations.

1258
01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.521
To boldly go where no one has gone before.
